#### Tier 1 ALP Programme
Our ALP Tier-1 programme is designed to provide students with a broad range of arts experiences and knowledge. At Secondary 1, students will have the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of digital photography, and learn about Music from the Southeast Asian region, as well as Western Classical Music. These subjects are carefully chosen to provide students with a strong foundation in the arts, and to help them develop their creativity and critical thinking skills.

Secondary 2 students will have the chance to delve even deeper into the arts, with areas such as Media, Visual Art, Music, and Dance. These subjects are carefully chosen to provide students with a well-rounded arts education, and to help them develop their skills in a variety of artistic disciplines. To foster student autonomy, Secondary 2 students will have the chance to select which area they are most interested in and want to explore in greater depth.

In addition to these subject-speciﬁc offerings, all students will also be exposed to different art forms through our ARTS Assembly Programme. This programme is designed to provide students with a glimpse into the world of arts beyond their classroom, and to help them appreciate the rich cultural heritage of different art forms.

Overall, our ALP Tier-1 programme is an exciting opportunity for students to explore the arts, develop their creativity, and gain valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.
