<p><strong>&nbsp;Tier 1-Broad-based Arts Exposure</strong>
</p>
<p>At the Tier-1 level, all students receive a strong foundation in the arts
through diverse and carefully curated experiences:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Secondary 1</strong> students
explore digital photography, Southeast Asian music traditions, and Western
Classical Music, building both cultural awareness and creative expression.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Secondary 2</strong> students
go deeper into Media, Visual Art, Music, or Dance. To foster autonomy,
they choose an area of specialization, encouraging ownership of their learning
while applying critical and inventive thinking.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the classroom, the <strong>ARTS Assembly Programme</strong> exposes
students to a variety of art forms, nurturing appreciation for the wider
cultural landscape.</p>
<p>These experiences broaden students’ perspectives, while cultivating creativity,
critical thinking, and adaptability - skills transferable to both academic
and future career contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tier 2 - Nurturing Talent &amp; Deepening Industry Connections</strong>
</p>
<p>For students with strong passion for the arts, Tier-2 provides extended

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Platforms such as <strong>ALP Arts Day </strong>and
the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</strong>, which allow students
to showcase their talents publicly, building confidence and resilience.</p>
<p>Through these real-world experiences, students not only deepen their artistic
skills but also build essential competencies - from adaptive problem-solving
to inventive exploration. Along the way, they learn to collaborate effectively,
express themselves with confidence, and make informed choices about their
future educational and career pathways.</p>
