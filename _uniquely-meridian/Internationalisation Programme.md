### Our Belief 

The school’s Internationalisation Programme is a holistic learning opportunity that we provide for our students, as we believe that developing cross-cultural competencies and building international friendships are important for their growth.

### Objectives of Trips for International Experience (TIE)

*   Deepen in our students the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities;
*   Expose students to Asia with a greater focus on ASEAN countries, India and China, and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world; and
*   Strengthen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

### 2024 and 2025

In 2024 and 2025, selected Secondary 3 students visited Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam), Chiang Mai (Thailand) and Beijing (China). These students researched the cultural, economical, language, historical aspects of the cities, and each country's bilateral ties with Singapore. 

They gained valuable experience by validating their findings through real-life observations, participating in hands-on cultural activities, interacting with local students, and learning more about the key industries in the countries they visited.  


Here are some photos of the trips:
