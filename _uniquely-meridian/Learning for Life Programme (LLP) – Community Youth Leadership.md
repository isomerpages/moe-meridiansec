<h4><strong>1. Principles of Leadership</strong></h4>

<p>The school integrates the <strong>Five K&amp;P Practices of Exemplary Leadership </strong>in
nurturing compassionate leaders.</p>
<p>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® is a functional leadership
model offered by James Kouzes and Barry Posner (1987) in their book, “The
Leadership Challenge.” It reveals a cluster of behaviours identified through
a thematic analysis of what people did when they were at their “personal
best” in leading others. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership are
namely Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable
Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>2. Student Leadership Model</strong></h4>

<p>The Student Leadership Model at Meridian Secondary School is designed
to be aligned with the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary
Leadership, the four beliefs, and The Meridian Way. At every tier of leadership
development, students are provided with opportunities to make meaningful
contributions to both the school community and the wider community.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Student Leadership Progressive Development Model</strong></h4>

<p>Meridian Secondary offers a multi-path, three-tier leadership training
programme that allows students to develop leadership skills through Self-Leadership,
Team Leadership and Thought Leadership. While the programme encourages
students to progress through each level, they may be recognized for Tier
3 leadership roles based on their achievements, even if they have not completed
Tier 2.</p>
<h4><strong>TIER 1</strong></h4>
<p>Cohort leadership engages the wider student body by equipping students
with an understanding of the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary
Leadership through a foundational programme. This programme not only helps
students develop their own skills and values, but also provides opportunities
to apply and enhance their leadership abilities through various platforms,
such as CCAs and VIA projects.</p>

</div>
<h4><strong>TIER 2</strong></h4>
<p>At Tier 2, students undergo further training and engage in a wider range
of community projects, enhancing their leadership skills through their
roles as CCA Leaders or Peer Support Leaders. These roles often involve
organizing activities for their peers (e.g., Peer Support Leaders conducting
class bonding games) or for their juniors (e.g., conducting leadership
workshops), fostering a sense of team leadership. Regular check-in sessions
provide ongoing guidance and support.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>TIER 3</strong></h4>
<p>At Tier 3, members of the Student Leader Executive Committee embody thought
leadership by inspiring a shared vision of student leadership that resonates
with all students. They play a pivotal role in nurturing the leadership
development of their peers and driving innovation to create value for the
community. To further enhance their capabilities, the Executive Committee
members are given opportunities to participate in nation-wide events and
are nominated for national-level awards (e.g., National Young Leaders Fellowship).</p>

<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;Values and Dispositions</strong></h4>
<p>Meridian’s leadership programme focuses not only on providing opportunities
for positional leadership development, but also on encouraging students
to take initiative, foster personal growth, and positively impact others.
We aim to develop students into change agents who help others grow, going
beyond just holding leadership titles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is achieved through two main initiatives:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive Committee (ExCo) – Any Secondary
3 student can apply to join the ExCo, where they will take on roles that
help influence and create value for the Meridian community.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visionary Volunteers programme – This programme
recognizes students for their contributions and achievements through a
star-based system (1 Star, 2 Stars, or 3 Stars), highlighting their dedication
to helping others and making a difference in the school community and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>5. Leaders Room</strong>
</p>
<p>The Leaders Room serves as a dedicated space for Student Leaders to convene,
collaborate, and strategize. It provides an environment where the leaders
can brainstorm innovative ideas and foster a sense of unity among their
peers. This room functions as a hub for nurturing leadership skills, enabling
students to chart a course for positive change within the school by fostering
creativity, teamwork, and the development of initiatives that benefit the
broader Meridian community.</p>
