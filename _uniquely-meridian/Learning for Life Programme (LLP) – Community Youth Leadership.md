<h3>Student Leadership at Meridian</h3>
<p>In Meridian, we believe that leadership can be learned. Our school aims
to strengthen the character and values of all Meridians under a structured
and differentiated Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) in Community Youth
Leadership (CYL). The school's Student Leadership programme reaches out
to all students in the school. Programmes are designed to span across cohorts
as well as differentiated groups to cater to students' interests, talents
and needs. The school actively partners with external organisations to
provide authentic and challenging learning experiences and assignments.
At the heart of our leadership approach is Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices
of Exemplary Leadership, which guide students to grow, lead, and lift others.
Meridians are encouraged to: <em>Model the Way</em>, <em>Inspire a Shared Vision</em>, <em>Challenge the Process</em>, <em>Enable Others to Act</em>,
and <em>Encourage the Heart</em> as they develop into confident and values-driven
leaders.</p>

<p>The Student Leadership Model at Meridian Secondary School is designed
to be aligned with the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary
Leadership, the four beliefs, and The Meridian Way. At every tier of leadership
development, students are provided with opportunities to make meaningful
contributions to both the school community and the wider community.</p>
<p>Meridian Secondary offers a multi-path, three-tier leadership training
programme that allows students to develop leadership skills through Self-Leadership,
Team Leadership and Thought Leadership. While the programme encourages
students to progress through each level, they may be recognized for Tier
3 leadership roles based on their achievements, even if they have not completed
Tier 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide a more holistic leadership experience, positional leadership
through the formal Tier 1 to Tier 3 progression is complemented by an emphasis
on dispositional leadership. Dispositional leadership is grounded in strong
personal values. By nurturing traits such as integrity, empathy, resilience
and a sense of responsibility, we aim to shape leaders who lead not only
through titles but also through character and consistent actions.</p>
<p>One example of this approach is the Visionary Volunteers programme. This
initiative empowers students to take ownership of their growth while embracing
the values of service and community engagement. Through such experiences,
students strengthen their leadership dispositions and broaden their impact
beyond formal roles.</p>
