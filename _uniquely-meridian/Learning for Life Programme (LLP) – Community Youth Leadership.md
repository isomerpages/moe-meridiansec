#### 1. Principles of Leadership


      <p><img src="/images/llp3.jpg" style="width:60%"></p>
			<p>The school integrates the Five K&amp;P Practices of Exemplary Leadership in developing student leaders.</p>
			<p>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® is a functional leadership model offered by James Kouzes and Barry Posner (1987) in their book, “The Leadership Challenge.” It reveals a cluster of behaviours identified through a thematic analysis of what people did when they were at their “personal best” in leading others. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership are namely Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.</p>

			<p>Meridian Secondary adopts an age-appropriate and progressive three-stage leadership training programme:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Leaders of Self</li>
				<li> Leaders of Peers</li>
				<li> Leaders of Community</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Tier 1</h3>
		<p>Cohort leadership reaches out to the masses. Hence, students will be equipped with the knowledge of K&amp;P principles through an anchor programme at the Lower Secondary level. They will then be provided with opportunities to apply their learning and practise leadership through various platforms such as CCAs and VIA activities.</p>

		<h3>Tier 2</h3>
		<p>At Tier 2, undergo further training and participate in a wider range of community projects to develop their skills as “Leaders of Peers” through their roles as Student Councillors, CCA Leaders, Class Chairpersons or Peer Support Leaders. As Leaders of Peers, our student leaders often conduct activities for peers of their level (e.g. Class Chairpersons conducting origami activity for their class during CNY celebration, or Peer Support Leaders conducting class bonding games), or for their juniors (e.g. Sec 3 Student Councillors facilitating Sec 2 VIA projects).</p>
		<p>Student leaders continue to attend developmental training programmes which are more specialized such as the Anti-bullying workshop, Proposal Writing workshop, and Events Management workshop. Regular check-in sessions are also conducted to provide guidance and support to the student leaders. What is unique to our school is that students are encouraged to step forward and nominate themselves to take on these leadership roles.</p>

		<h3>TIER 3</h3>

      <p>With Community Youth Leadership being the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Primary Six students can look forward to applying to Meridian Secondary through the DSA Leadership programme. Sec 1 Students who are selected for admission through the school’s DSA Leadership programme will have an advantage over their peers – they will, by default, be accepted into the school’s Tier 2 Leadership programme.</p>
