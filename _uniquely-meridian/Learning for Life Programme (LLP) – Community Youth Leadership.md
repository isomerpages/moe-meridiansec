#### 1. Principles of Leadership

![](/images/Uniquely%20Meridian/LLP%20Community%20Youth%20Leadership/llp_02.jpg)

The school integrates the **Five K&amp;P Practices of Exemplary Leadership** in nurturing compassionate leaders.

The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® is a functional leadership model offered by James Kouzes and Barry Posner (1987) in their book, “The Leadership Challenge.” It reveals a cluster of behaviours identified through a thematic analysis of what people did when they were at their “personal best” in leading others. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership are namely Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.

The Student Leadership Model at Meridian Secondary School is designed to be aligned with the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership, the four beliefs, and The Meridian Way. At every tier of leadership development, students are provided with opportunities to make meaningful contributions to both the school community and the wider community.


#### 3. 	Student Leadership Progressive Development Model

Meridian Secondary adopts an age-appropriate and progressive three-stage leadership training programme:
* Self Leadership
* Team Leadership
* Thought Leadership

##### Tier 1
Cohort leadership reaches out to the masses. Students will be equipped with the knowledge of K&amp;P principles through a foundational programme during their Lower Secondary years. Subsequently, they will have a chance to apply and refine their leadership skills through various platforms such as CCAs and VIA activities.

##### TIER 2 
At Tier 2, students undergo further training and participate in a wider range of community projects to develop their skills as “Leaders of Peers” through their roles as Student Councillors, CCA Leaders, Class Chairpersons, or Peer Support Leaders. As Leaders of Peers, our Student Leaders often conduct activities for peers of their level (e.g. Peer Support Leaders conducting class bonding games), or for their juniors (e.g. Sec 3 Student Councillors facilitating Sec 2 VIA projects). 

Student Leaders continue to attend developmental training programmes which are more specialized such as the Proposal Writing workshop and Events Facilitation workshop. Regular check-in sessions are also conducted to provide guidance and support to the Student Leaders. To stretch their abilities, Student Leaders are provided with opportunities to participate in events and/or are nominated for awards at the national level (e.g. Our Singapore Leadership Programme and National Youth Environment Conference). What is unique to our school is that students are encouraged to step forward and nominate themselves to take on these leadership roles.

##### TIER 3 
At Tier 3, the ExCo Student Council members inspire a shared student leadership vision that resonates across all Meridians. They take charge of organizing school events, such as Staff Appreciation Day and Graduation Day, and play a pivotal role in nurturing the leadership growth of Student Councillors.
