<p>The school integrates the <strong>Five K&amp;P Practices of Exemplary Leadership </strong>in
nurturing compassionate leaders.</p>
<p>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® is a functional leadership
model offered by James Kouzes and Barry Posner (1987) in their book, “The
Leadership Challenge.” It reveals a cluster of behaviours identified through
a thematic analysis of what people did when they were at their “personal
best” in leading others. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership are
namely Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable
Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student Leadership Model</strong></h4>

<p>The Student Leadership Model at Meridian Secondary School is designed
to be aligned with the Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary
Leadership, the four beliefs, and The Meridian Way. At every tier of leadership
development, students are provided with opportunities to make meaningful
contributions to both the school community and the wider community.</p>

<p>Meridian Secondary adopts an age-appropriate and progressive three-stage
leadership training programme:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Self-Leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team Leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought Leadership</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>TIER 1</strong></h4>
<p>Cohort leadership engages the wider student body by equipping our students
with knowledge of K&amp;P principles through a foundational programme.
This programme not only helps them develop their own skills and values
but also provides opportunities to apply and enhance their leadership abilities
through various platforms such as CCAs and VIA projects.</p>

</div>
<h4><strong>TIER 2</strong></h4>
<p>At Tier 2, students receive further training and participate in a broader
range of community projects, enhancing their leadership skills through
their roles as Student Councillors, CCA Leaders or Peer Support Leaders.
This often involves organizing activities for their peers (e.g. Peer Support
Leaders conducting class bonding games) or for their juniors (e.g. Sec
3 Student Councillors facilitating Sec 2 VIA projects), fostering a sense
of team leadership.</p>
<p>The Leadership Primer is specially designed for Tier 2 Student Leaders,
focusing on developing skills such as public speaking and event facilitation.
Regular check-in sessions offer continuous guidance and support. Uniquely,
our school encourages students to self-nominate for these leadership roles,
promoting initiative and self-development.</p>

<h4><strong>TIER 3</strong></h4>
<p>At Tier 3, members of the Student Leader Executive Committee embody thought
leadership by inspiring a shared vision of student leadership that resonates
with all students. They play a pivotal role in nurturing the leadership
development of their peers and driving innovation to create value for the
community. To further enhance their capabilities, the Executive Committee
members are given opportunities to participate in nation-wide events and
are nominated for national-level awards (e.g., National Young Leaders Fellowship).</p>

<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaders Room</strong></h4>
<p>The Leaders Room serves as a dedicated space for Student Leaders to convene,
collaborate, and strategize. It provides an environment where the leaders
can brainstorm innovative ideas and foster a sense of unity among their
peers. This room functions as a hub for nurturing leadership skills, enabling
students to chart a course for positive change within the school by fostering
creativity, teamwork, and the development of initiatives that benefit the
broader Meridian community.</p>
