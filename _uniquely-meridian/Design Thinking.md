<h2>DESIGN THINKING</h2>
<p>The Design Thinking (DT) framework at Meridian Secondary School underwent
refinement to enhance the iterative process. This approach, based on ‘Feel-Think-Do-Share’,
drives innovation and emphasises empathetic engagement, supporting student
well-being through adaptive thinking.</p>

<p>DT has become integral to various school aspects, including student-led
VIA, timetabling and the Professional Learning Teams (PLTs). In PLTs, Design
Thinking guides the creation of problem statements and influences the structure
of mid-point sharing through lightning talks. The framework is also embedded
into student-teacher conversations within relational circles, fostering
a culture of empathy and deeper understanding. This refined approach aligns
with the school's collaborative efforts and the emphasis on iterative development.</p>

<h2>STUDENT INNOVATION</h2>
<h3>STUDENTS</h3>
<p>Secondary 1 students will experience the DT process of ‘Feel’, ‘Think’
‘Do’ and ‘Share’ through an in-house workshop conducted within the FCE
lesson. To experience empathy (Feel), they will be given a scenario in
which they have to re-enact. They will then brainstorm on possible solutions
and create a prototype of their chosen solution.</p>
<p>Thereafter, students will explain their chosen problem issue and prototype
to their classmates. Classmates will then be given the opportunity to provide
feedback on their friends’ prototypes.</p>
<p>In using the DT process, users are required to apply several 21st Century
Skills such as creative, adaptive thinking, decision making, new media
literacy, empathy and cross-disciplinary competency by coming up with solutions
to improve our current living environment and its processes. Through DT,
Meridian Secondary aims to inspire learners to be innovative problem solvers
and effective decision makers, equipping them effectively to face future
challenges in the real world.</p>
<p>DT will be incorporated progressively into the school processes and programmes
for staff and students respectively. For students, the DT approach will
be implemented in three main school programmes. The three programmes are
Food and Consumer Education (FCE)/ Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) at
Sec 1, Applied Learning Programe (ALP) at Sec 2, and Values-In-Action (VIA)
at Sec 3 as these subjects and/school programmes lend themselves to the
use of the DT process.</p>
<h3>STUDENT LEADERS</h3>
<p>A group of Sec 3 student leaders go through further DT training to apply
their skills in various school needs and in the community.</p>

<h2>STAFF INNOVATION</h2>
<p>All staff are trained in Design Thinking through an in-house workshop
conducted by the Innovation Team.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, all staff went through a Design Thinking
(DT) Refresher Workshop. This workshop aims to strengthen teachers’ knowledge
on DT processes, focusing on the ‘Empathy’ stage.</p>
<p>With the enhanced knowledge in DT, which is a tool for innovation, staff
will then apply the processes into their various areas of work for improvements
and innovation.</p>

<p>Staff submit their ideas via the Changemakers Challenge and the best ideas
are shared with all staff via video and recognised during Staff Contact
Time and social media.</p>
