<p><strong>Talent Development in Art at Meridian</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Meridian Art Enrichment Programme (MAEP), &amp;</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enhanced Art Programme (EAP)</strong>
</p>
<p>At Meridian Secondary School, the <strong>Talent Development Programme </strong>nurtures
students with strong interest and aptitude in Art through two pathways: <strong>The Meridian Art Enrichment Programme (MAEP)</strong> in
lower secondary and the <strong>Enhanced Art Programme (EAP)</strong> in
upper secondary.</p>
<p><strong>As one of the only nine secondary schools in Singapore offering the MOE Enhanced Art Programme (EAP), </strong>Meridian
provides our students with advanced opportunities to pursue their passion
in Art.<strong> </strong>This distinction underscores our commitment to
developing young artists through artistic learning experiences, industry
exposure, and opportunities to showcase their work.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <strong>MAEP</strong>, students
are encouraged to be <strong>curious and explorative</strong>, experimenting
with ideas, materials, and techniques, and to become <strong>confident and expressive</strong> in
sharing their artistic voice.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <strong>EAP</strong>, students
grow to be <strong>disciplined and reflective</strong>, refining their practice
through deeper inquiry and critique, while also becoming <strong>innovative and professional</strong>,
connecting their art to real-world contexts and future pathways in the
creative industries.</p>
<p>Through this developmental journey, the Art Talent Development Programme
shapes<strong> students who explore Art widely, deepen their practice, and present with confidence and excellence.</strong>
