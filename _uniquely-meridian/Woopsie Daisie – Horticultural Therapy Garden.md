<p>The Care Team has worked together with Hortherapeutics to build a Horticultural
Therapy Garden in school.</p>
<p>The objective of building the garden is to provide nature-based intervention
support for students with acute social-emotional and mental health (SEMH)
problems and other additional needs such as special educational needs (SEN)
or at-risk. Horticultural therapy has been shown to have a positive impact
on individuals' mental and emotional well-being, making it an excellent
choice for addressing the needs of these students.</p>
<p>The school inaugurated our Therapy Garden, Woopsie Daise, on 25 October
2022. During the meaningful event, our students shared their experience
on how the garden has helped them and parents as well as the SAC members
also planted daisies in the garden as part of the opening ceremony.</p>

<h3>Yearly Highlight</h3>
<p>Several nature-based workshops were conducted for our students using the
natural materials from the garden. We have received many positive feedback
from students. Many has expressed their interests to participate in future
therapeutic workshops.</p>
<h4>2023</h4>
<p>The school collaborated with Wild Dot to organize a 2-day workshop called
the Living with Colours. Students were able to make their own colours using
the natural materials from the garden and explore their artistic side by
painting on their blank canvas. Students thoroughly enjoyed this workshop
as they get to discover colours through unconventional method which make
this workshop unique and interesting for them.</p>
<h4>2022</h4>
<p>For many, this was their first time getting in touch with nature. They
used their 5 senses to create their very own Terrarium. Students enjoyed
getting their hands dirty while decorating their jar. At the end of the
workshop, many left feeling happy and satisfied with their final product.</p>
