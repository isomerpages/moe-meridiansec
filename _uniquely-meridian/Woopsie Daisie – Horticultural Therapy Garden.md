<p>The Care Team collaborated with Hortherapeutics to build a Horticultural
Therapy Garden in school with the aim of providing nature-based intervention
support for students with social-emotional and mental health (SEMH) needs,
special educational needs (SEN), and those who may be at risk. Research
has shown that horticultural therapy can positively influence emotional
well-being and self-regulation, making it a meaningful and supportive approach
for these students.</p>
<p>The school inaugurated our Therapy Garden, Woopsie Daisie, on 25 October
2022. During the meaningful launch event, students shared how the garden
had supported them in their journey, and parents, together with School
Advisory Committee members, planted daisies as part of the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>Woopsie Daisie was later revamped in October 2025 to further enhance its
therapeutic benefits. A new water feature was added, providing gentle visual
movement that creates a calming and reflective atmosphere for emotional
regulation. Adjacent to the garden is a small hut where students can sit
quietly, relax, and appreciate the surrounding greenery.</p>
<p>While the garden continues to serve students through structured therapeutic
interventions, it is also open to all students who wish to take a peaceful
stroll, enjoy a mindful moment in nature, or even capture some Instagram-worthy
photos.</p>

<h3>Yearly Highlight</h3>
<p>Several nature-based workshops were conducted for our students using the
natural materials from the garden. We have received many positive feedback
from students. Many has expressed their interests to participate in future
therapeutic workshops.</p>
<h4>2023</h4>
<p>The school collaborated with Wild Dot to organize a 2-day workshop called
the Living with Colours. Students were able to make their own colours using
the natural materials from the garden and explore their artistic side by
painting on their blank canvas. Students thoroughly enjoyed this workshop
as they get to discover colours through unconventional method which make
this workshop unique and interesting for them.</p>
<h4>2022</h4>
<p>For many, this was their first time getting in touch with nature. They
used their 5 senses to create their very own Terrarium. Students enjoyed
getting their hands dirty while decorating their jar. At the end of the
workshop, many left feeling happy and satisfied with their final product.</p>
