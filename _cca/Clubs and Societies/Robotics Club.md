### About Us

The Robotics Club was set up in March 2001 to allow our students to channel their creative and innovative energies. Currently, the club has evolved the knowledge to a few coding programs from MicroBit, Lego EV3 and the latest one, Lego Spike Prime. We also have an interest group who does coding Anaconda – Python and Cloud computing to make the Robotics sessions more inclusive and engaging.

The Robotics members are creative, inquisitive, and enthusiastic young people who have desire to learn the latest development of robotics technology which will promote sustainability or green technology. With solid foundation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) coupled with good research and presentation skills, the Robotics Club members believed in being a holistic life-long students of the 21st century and gearing towards Smart nation.
