The Meridian Media Club is made up of a close-knitted group of students who share a common interest in photography, videography and live sound production. They work tirelessly around the school to support all her visual and media needs throughout the year.

The students serve the school in many areas, ranging from the smooth running of the morning assemblies, to playing a pivotal role in ensuring the success of every major events and concerts. They also capture the important moments in these events for the purpose of sharing on social media platforms and keeping these precious moments for future publications.

Trainings by professionals are also conducted to further widen the studentsâ€™ skills in photography and videography. The club members participate in competitions such as the Our Schools, Our Stories photo and video contest to stretch themselves further.
