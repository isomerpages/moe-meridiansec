### About Us

Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players where they will be assigned to specific positions. Besides learning the technical parts of the sport, our students will learn how to communicate and cooperate with each other while playing the games which will help to improve their social and verbal skills.

Netball promotes friendships among the players as they learn, play, and grow together. We hope to foster a strong sense of commitment, responsibility and loyalty to the school, community, and nation.

### Vision

We believe in developing our students holistically. Through the discipline of training and competitions, students will develop values and competencies that will prepare them for the challenges of their future.

### Team Quote

_**Team before Self**_

As a team sport, we believe that everyone plays an essential part of the team. With great teamwork, our girls can work together towards a common vision. This belief is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.

### Our CCA Experience

_Being in netball allowed me to realise just how important teamwork and perseverance is. I was able overcome my fear of failure and work on myself for the better of the team with the help of my fellow teammates._

**– Chervel (3E4 2022), Sec 3 Captain**

_Netball is a team sport, and this allowed me to learn how to work as a team and communicate with them when necessary. During competitions like NSG, we learn to persevere through the games together as a team instead of just giving up when knowing we may be at the losing end._

**– Sheryl (3E4 2022), Sec 3 Vice-captain**
