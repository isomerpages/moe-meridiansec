### About Us

The MSS Badminton CCA consists of both girls and boys team. The East Zone Badminton Tournament is the annual highlight, in which the team competes in singles and double matches under the ‘B’ and ‘C’ divisions\*.

### Our Objective:

*   To develop members’ badminton, playing skills, fitness level and game tactics
*   To instill team spirit, sportsmanship, and discipline in badminton
*   To develop leadership qualities in every player

The team trains on a weekly basis, under the guidance of an experienced Coach and Teachers-in-charge. The weekly training helps the players to level up their skills in playing badminton and also build up their stamina and endurance. Sportsmanship and character are also heavily emphasised in MSS Badminton. Students are given various leadership positions, which promote character development and instill discipline.
