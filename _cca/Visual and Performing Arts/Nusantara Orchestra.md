The Meridian Nusantara Orchestra (MNO) is a unique Performing Arts CCA which incorporates both Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble and Gamelan Ensemble.

The MNO is unique to the region and the world as it is the only orchestra that uses traditional Indonesian gamelan instruments but tuned to the international diatonic and chromatic music scale of western instruments. This has also allowed the fusion of western instruments and percussions in the orchestra, making it a truly Singaporean Orchestra with an international perspective.

**Objectives:**

*   To nurture in students an appreciation of traditional Indonesian music.
*   To develop students’ discipline, confidence, resilience and team spirit through trainings and performances.
