### About Us

The Meridian Secondary School (MSS) Choir was formed in 1999 by the late Madam Ong Foon. The Choir aims to bring out the best in all members through rigorous training in vocal techniques and musicality. Opportunities are also given to develop students’ leadership skills. As a whole, MSS Choir provides students with avenues to develop their interpersonal skills when working together, and also areas to build their personal confidence and self-esteem when they perform regularly on stage. The Choir has grown to a proud strength of 60 singers. Since 2019, we have recruited male voices and are now a full SATB Choir (Sopranos, Altos, Tenors and Basses)!

The Choir actively performs in school events. Other performances include the National Day Parade as part of the Combined Secondary School Choir, charitable concerts at Changi General Hospital, and Pasir Ris West CC events.

### Highlights

The MSS Choir has established itself as a pivotal Performing Arts group in Meridian Secondary School with its track record of offering its members a comprehensive programme that promotes the holistic development of its members. Besides equipping its members with the technical skills of singing and developing their sense of musicality, the Choir also provides its members with a unique and valuable opportunity to experience the intricacies of working with a group of fellow musicians.

#### **2022**

_**Sec 4 Values in Action – Showing Appreciation to Support Staff**_  
To show appreciation to our school’s non-teaching support staff for their hard work and dedicated service, as well as to bring joy, positivity and sense of community to them, our Sec 4 Choir members embarked on a VIA project to produce a video recording of the song “Evening Rise”. Kudos to our Sec 4s for their months of unyielding practice, rehearsals, and a wonderful studio recording!

With detailed planning and preparations, Choir successfully executed a smooth Sec 1 CCA Experience-cum-Trial programme over a few weeks. Through lively and interesting presentations, interactions and trials, our members were able to fully engage the Sec 1s and pique their interest to joining Choir.

Term 3 started with a formal farewell for the Sec 4s. The Sec 1-3s were eager to show their appreciation to their seniors and organised a most wonderous event. The seniors were pampered with food and snacks, and taken down the memory lane with games and quizzes. A big shout-out to Sec 4s for your leadership, your dedication and most importantly for your tender love and care of the juniors. You will be sorely missed!

_**Training and Exposure**_

*Concerts & Workshop*

Choir aims to provide our members with a platform to develop their passion for singing through learning different genres of music and sing well with confidence while performing. What better to way is there to learn than by attending concerts and participating in related workshops? Members made use of the June and September school holidays to attend a concert, Nelson’s Voyage, held at the Victoria Concert Hall as well as participated in two workshops held under the auspice of the Voices of Singapore Festival 2022.

*Audio & Video Recording ~ Can You Feel The Love Tonight*

To increase members’ musical sensitivity and hone their vocal skills in attaining accuracy in pitch, tune and melody, all members were exposed to music video production process – small group audio recording and on-site video recording. So sit back and enjoy MSS Choir’s performance of The Lion King Theme song – Can you feel the love tonight!

_**National Day performance**_  

The highlight of this Term 3 was most definitely the National Day Celebrations where Choir finally had the chance to perform “live”. Choir was the first item of the day. With our rendition of “The Road Ahead”, Choir managed to engage the students and draw them into celebrating the nation’s birthday.

_**Jubilate – Joint Concert with Band**_  

There is no better way to wrap up the year than a joint concert with Band. Jubilate – there were certainly good reasons to rejoice and celebrate our performance with a “live” audience in many years. It was certainly a feather in the cap, with parents here to witness the fruits of all the hours of hard work and practices. Well done, Choir!

Choir students ventured into other musical talents which do not require singing, as the school adheres to the safety management measures. Here is a percussion workshop led by Ms Sng. Our students definitely have fun beating their drumsticks to the fun, upbeat and lively rhythm of Brazilian Samba!

     style="width:50%">

_Because of Choir, I was able to grow and improve my confidence on stage. I have made numerous friends in Choir, with many supportive seniors and juniors. I have picked up many exciting new songs such as “A Million Dreams”, singing and enjoying them with my friends. I have most definitely improved my singing techniques._

**– Eaty Shyam Sheetal, 2E4, 2022 (Assistant Section Leader)**

_To me, Choir is not just a CCA, it is a time when I can relax, have fun, and learn at the same time. Choir is also a place where I get to make friends with people from other classes and levels. Through Choir, I have learnt to be a better team player and understand music better. I have joined the Choir with an open mind and am glad to be able to pick up quickly the music theory that our conductor has taught us. Choir also further enhanced my interest in music and singing._

_I thought joining choir was just about singing but I was so wrong. I went in with an opened-mind and I realized that singing in a choir can develop me holistically as a person. On top of that, we got to sing songs from different races, languages, and cultures. It has been indeed an enriching experience._
