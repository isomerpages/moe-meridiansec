### About Us

Under the baton of our main band conductors, Mr Pan Chee Mun and Mr Gabriel Song, the Meridian Concert Band aims to provide positive and enriching student development experiences (SDEs) for our members.

We believe that students learn best from experiences and exposure, and that is why the band programme includes an array of activities – such as tutoring sessions from instrumental specialists, master classes with guest conductors, team-building activities, public performances, exchange programmes with other schools and opportunities to attend various external concerts and workshops.

Besides equipping band members with musicianship skills through the wide range of exclusive programmes and activities, the band also believes in developing confident and competent performers and leaders, offering platforms in leadership programmes such as the Drum Major Camp, Combined Music CCA Leadership Camp and Band Student Conductor Camp.

Guided by our motto, ‘**One Band, One Sound**’, the band strives to empower all members to attain their fullest potential as musicians. To better support our Secondary 1 students, we have the senior mentors to guide them.
