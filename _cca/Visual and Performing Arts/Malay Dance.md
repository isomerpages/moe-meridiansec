Meridian Malay Dance consists of energetic, dynamic and artistic young people with talent and love for dance. Dance, to them, is a holistic endeavour. The Malay dancers believe that to dance is to share with the world their story and their feelings. To dance is to instil the love for arts, as well as a form of cultural expression and a means of connecting socially. It is with these aims and principle in mind that the Malay dance members were put through a series of performances, competitions, community collaborations, and leadership initiatives throughout 2019. They never fail to present fascinating performances that reflect their uniqueness and passion for the arts and culture. Their proud moment came when they clinched the distinction award at the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival. Other performances include: a dance during the ChillBox Opening and a public performance at the Pasir Ris West Community Centre Chinese New Year Concert, where the dancers showcased a fusion dance incorporating the different ethnic dances in Singapore. This year under Mr Mohamed Rizal, the dancers performed at the Pasir Ris West Community Centre for the Chinese New Year Celebrations.

During SYF 2019, they charmed the judges with their performance, a traditional dance entitled Lenggok Qaseh. This dance was symbolic of the schools’ merger and the unity and friendship formed between the dancers from the two schools through a common love for dance. This SYF journey has turned strangers to friends and taught them the importance of teamwork, humility and inclusiveness. Their elated teacher-in-charge, Mrs Sarala Rajan, remarked that the award was testimony of their perseverance and talent.
