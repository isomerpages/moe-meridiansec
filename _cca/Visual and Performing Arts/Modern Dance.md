### About Us

Through Meridian Modern Dance, dancers are exposed and experienced various genres of dance, from Hip Hop, to Urban, Street Jazz. The dancers learn good posture and awareness of body in space, developing coordination of arms feet and head, exercises that focus on core and posture.

  
Our dance goes beyond just learning the steps and movements, as we also focus on imparting the right values through dance. We adopt inclusive approach as we believe in creating opportunities for everyone to thrive and make an impact for our CCA.

### Our CCA Experience

_We are a welcoming club who believes in unity. Training sessions in Modern Dance have been very uplifting as dancers consistently support and encourage one another._

**– Sha’ista, Sec 3E3, 2022**

_In preparation for a single performance, we practice for hours as we believe dancing is a journey that requires much discipline and perseverance, physically and mentally._
