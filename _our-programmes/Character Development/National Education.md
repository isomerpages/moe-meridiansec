### International Friendship Day 2022

With the theme, Singapore In The World, International Friendship Day (IFD) commemoration activities help our students realise the importance of forging good international relations with others. The day started off with our Principal Mr Razali’s sharing on the situation in Ukraine and its impact on Singapore. Thereafter, Sec 1, 2, 4 and 5 students continued the engaging discussions during CCE periods while the Sec 3 students attended the sharing sessions by our International Students which were planned together by the CCE Team and the Internationalisation Team.
