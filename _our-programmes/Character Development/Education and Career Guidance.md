Education & Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with essential knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions for life post-secondary school.

Through the school’s ECG activities, we aim to help students:

*   discover their interests, abilities and passion,
*   learn more about the world of work and explore the many possible pathways,
*   make considered decisions about their education and career plans, and stay on track to achieve them, and
*   be a lifelong learner who is adaptable and resilient, and equipped with the 21st century competencies, values and skills.

# Highlights

### MySkillsFuture Portal

The [ECG Portal – MySkillsFuture](http://www.myskillsfuture.sg/secondary) is a valuable source of information and knowledge for students. By completing the surveys on the portal, students learn more about their interests, strengths and work values (VIPS). The portal is also a guide to their post-secondary education. Students are able to learn more about the education landscape, and explore the Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) as well as the courses offered by these institutions. They also learn about the world of work, acquiring knowledge of the Singapore Industry Landscape and the various job roles.

In Meridian, students utilized MySkillsFuture Portal to find out about their VIPS and to set academic and non-academic goals to chart their holistic growth.
