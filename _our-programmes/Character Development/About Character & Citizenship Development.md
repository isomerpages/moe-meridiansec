### CCE in MSS

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students develop character and citizenship dispositions which enable them to grow holistically. Our school takes reference from MOE CCE Curriculum Frame to design meaningful learning experiences for our Meridians.

### Character & Citizenship Development in MSS

In Meridian Secondary, we emphasise the importance of nurturing Meridians to be people of good character and useful citizens. Through the programmes and structures in place, we aim to inculcate values and build social-emotional competencies to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.

### Enactment of CCE in The Classroom

Explicit teaching of knowledge, skills and values take place in the classroom. Hence, elevating student voice by allowing them to share their experiences, stories, opinions and differing views in the classroom becomes important to make learning more authentic. To facilitate this, we leverage on technology, on top of other facilitation strategies, to increase students’ engagement and participation in lessons so that they have meaningful discussions on the various CCE topics. These lessons are facilitated by Form Teachers or by their peers.

### Positive Education

Meridian Secondary embarked on Positive Education as an approach to blend academic learning with character and well-being. Seligman’s revised PERMAH model was adopted (studied and published by Norrish & Seligman in 2015), which stands for six elements of psychological well-being and happiness. The six elements stand for P – Positive Emotions, E – Engagement, R – Relationships, M – Meaning, A – Achievements and H – Health.

### Thoughtful Thursdays

To complement our CCE efforts, we initiated Thoughtful Thursdays as part of Positive Education in Meridian Secondary. It aims to support students in tackling unprecedented levels of pressure and build mental resilience.  
During these sessions, Meridians learn how to manage their mental health and inculcate positive emotions through a variety of bite-sized activities, which focus on themes such as Gratitude, Mindfulness, Resilience, etc.

#### Promoting positive well-being through gratitude reflection
