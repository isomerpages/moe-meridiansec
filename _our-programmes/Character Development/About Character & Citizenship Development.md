### CCE in MSS

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students develop character and citizenship dispositions which enable them to grow holistically. Our school takes reference from MOE CCE Curriculum Frame to design meaningful learning experiences for our Meridians.

### Character & Citizenship Development in MSS

In Meridian Secondary, we emphasise the importance of nurturing Meridians to be people of good character and useful citizens. Through the programmes and structures in place, we aim to inculcate values and build social-emotional competencies to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.

### Enactment of CCE in The Classroom

Explicit teaching of knowledge, skills and values take place in the classroom. Hence, elevating student voice by allowing them to share their experiences, stories, opinions and differing views in the classroom becomes important to make learning more authentic. To facilitate this, we leverage on technology, on top of other facilitation strategies, to increase studentsâ€™ engagement and participation in lessons so that they have meaningful discussions on the various CCE topics. These lessons are facilitated by Form Teachers or by their peers.
