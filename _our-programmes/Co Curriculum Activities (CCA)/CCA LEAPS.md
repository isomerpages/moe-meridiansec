CCA in secondary school is compulsory as it is an integral part of the curriculum in providing a holistic education for secondary school students. CCA provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning. This includes learning not just in the academic areas. Equally important is the development of values and life skills in each child. This will equip the child to handle the challenges in life later on. 

CCA LEAPS 2.0 is a framework to recognize secondary school students’ holistic development. Students will be recognized with levels of attainment in four domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.

At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognized according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Education (JC/Poly/ITE).
