### About Us

The Meridian Drama Club (MDC) encourages students who have an interest in drama to practise and showcase their talents to the school. Club members are not only trained to explore acting but also provided with an all-rounded learning experience and appreciation for the theatre. Besides acting, club members perform a diverse range of tasks; from working on sets for performances to creation of costumes, as well as lighting and sound design. This ultimately allows one to develop essential life skills such as confidence, improvisation, effective language and communication and emotional intelligence through warm-up exercises, bonding games and various other activities.

Meridian Drama Club participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging of Drama (SYF) biannually and has consistently been doing outstandingly well. In the last 2 SYF competitions, Meridian Drama Club attained a Distinction Award for their performances in 2019 and 2021.

### Our CCA Experience

_Personally, my experience as a junior in Meridian Drama Club has been interesting and enjoyable. I revel at my seniors on how approachable and communicative they are. As a club we are very comfortable with each other and are always helping one another. It really warms my heart to see such camaraderie in my CCA. Our Drama coach, Mr Danny has made all of us feel very welcome. He patiently answers all our queries and will come up with the best possible solutions to help any situations we are facing. He is very confident as a coach and we have certainly learnt a repertoire of skills from him. I remember when I first started I had horrible stage fright. But now, it’s much better now due to the encouragement of my Drama mates. If you’re someone who wants to overcome your fears, take the challenge and join us. I promise you, you will not regret it. In the words of our instructor, Mr Danny, “Confidence is a choice.” So make that choice._

_When I first entered the Meridian Drama Club, I was scared and not a confident person. I was very conscious of people laughing at me for the way I act and perform. I also felt judged for joining this CCA. However, I soon realized that the club was more like a family to me. I started off as a student who only knew about one type of acting. I soon learnt about physical theater, musicals and screen work. Drama taught me that no matter what I do in life, I must NEVER be scared of anything or anyone. Through my CCA training, I became confident in myself. My Drama coach always says that “confidence is a choice!” And I have learnt that it truly is. Now, I am more confident in myself and proud to be someone from the Drama Club. I do not have any problem in speaking up or even performing in front of my friends because of my training. It was wonderful to have teachers recommend me for being a Meridian speaker and also for student council. I was also elected as Vice- Chairperson of the club. It has boosted my morale and I have grown to be a better person even in leadership. Being given this role, I have opportunities to lead the club, hone my skills in communication, impart my ideas and observations of the members in the club and how we can improve as a team. I have learned to be a more responsible student by making sure i remember everything my instructor says and implementing these when I lead warm-ups and activities. To sum it up, being in Meridian Drama Club has helped me to be more disciplined during busy periods such as Singapore Youth Festival and school productions._

_The Meridian Drama Club changed my life. Before secondary school I was a very shy and meek boy, lacking confidence. But now I am capable of confidently talking to others that I may not be very close with, even strangers, when I could not before. I have participated in many of the Club’s performances, from the SYF 2021 to our latest performance of the NDP 2022 skit. I think I have developed quite a lot in that timeframe, in becoming a better actor and person. Although the rehearsals were vigorous, especially for SYF, I think it was worth it for the journey along the way, working for the performance, and taking my part in making the Drama Club a distinction award club. Not only that, I have also met many good friends inside the Drama Club, people who I am extremely fond of. I consider it my safe and happy space._
