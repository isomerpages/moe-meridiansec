### Internationalisation Programme

**Our belief in the programme**

Since 2018, one of the signature programmes for the entire secondary three cohort is the Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) that marks the end of the academic year.  The school’s Internationalisation Programme belief is that it forms a part of our provision for a holistic education within the classroom and without.  As such, we are committed to provide every student with an opportunity to travel overseas with the school at least once in their 4-5 years of education with us.

**The objectives of Trips for International Experience (TIE)**

*   Deepen in our students the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.
*   Expose students to Asia with a greater focus on ASEAN countries and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world.
*   Strengthen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

In 2019, a total of 6 OLJ destinations were organised from Malaysia to Thailand, Vietnam and China.

**Our process**

Annually, the school will identify various destinations with emphasis on ASEAN countries for students to select.  Each trip is headed by one of the Secondary 3 Form Teachers (FTs) with other FTs acting as chaperones for all the trips organized.  This process offers opportunities for all involved to not only build a stronger teacher-student rapport outside a classroom setting but more importantly, allows for greater social mixing with other students across the classes and streams.  Each trip’s itinerary will also include an immersion experience with a hosting school helping students learn about the lives of their peers abroad.

**The strengths of the OLJ**

*   Powerful learning experience to help students develop confidence, independence and responsibility through immersion in a different environment.
*   Develop understanding of another country’s culture, history and development broadening the students’ world view.
*   Opportunities for interaction with Meridian schoolmates and overseas friends.

At the end of each trip, through their reflections and feedback, students have recorded overwhelming support for the programme as they have gained much from the OLJ experience; from learning about themselves and others; about the culture and life of the places and countries they have visited and how much they have learnt about Singapore’s place in the world. The most priceless impact of the OLJ is that the students expressed a greater sense of appreciation for our country.

			<p>During my overseas trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, I had an enjoyable and refreshing experience, learning and understanding the new culture and heritage. Though I was a little nervous going overseas myself, I have really enjoyed myself in the company of my new friends. Through the tours around the Van Mieu Temple, the 1st university of Vietnam built in the 11th century, and a number of museums, I had a deeper understanding and appreciation for Vietnam’s culture, history and heritage, which is something that may not always be taught in classrooms. We also had an opportunity to watch a water puppet show. It was mesmerising listening to the music and seeing how the puppets were manoeuvred across the water. In this trip, we also went to Ba Vi Village to learn and experience the hardship of agriculture in Vietnam. One of the highlights of this trip was the cultural exchange at Le Quy Don High School. It was very fun and enjoyable when we played numerous games with each other and experience how the lessons are conducted in the school. I was able to forge many unforgettable friendships with some of students I met there and learnt many new interesting things about Vietnam. Last but not least, we were also given the opportunity to shop around Hanoi Old Quarters Street. It was full of hustle and bustle, and there was a large variety of goods at affordable prices. This overseas trip has been truly unforgettable. – Ellasandra, 3E1</p>

			<p>During the overseas learning journey to Hanoi, Vietnam, I have learnt many new things and understood the rich history and culture of Vietnam. Throughout the trip, I have many experiences, which I can never experience in Singapore. Through this trip, I was able to make many new friends.  <br>
My most memorable experience was visiting the Le Quy Don Junior High School for the exchange programme. This is because the students over at the school were very friendly and welcoming.  They were very prepared to host us and all of them had big smiles on their faces when they greeted us. They encouraged us to participate in many activities like the tug of war and ice breaker games. <br><br>
I really enjoyed the activities organised.  One of them was the water puppet show that is iconic in Vietnam. It is very interesting to watch the puppeteers perform such an interesting show. We also visited some museums which helped us deepen our understanding of the Vietnam war and the different clans of Vietnam.  <br>
Overall, this trip was a very enjoyable trip because I got to visit a country with a rich history and made many precious memories with my friends. – Oh Jun Yue, 3A1</p>

			<p>Through this trip, I learnt about the rich history and culture of Vietnam. We visited Hoa Lo Prison, a prison used by the French colonists for political prisoners. We were shown the actual cells prisoners lived in and saw depictions of the grueling lifestyle of every prisoner. We also visited a museum where we were educated on the numerous ethnic groups and their rich culture.  I have also learnt that Vietnam is a country ruined by war and we should appreciate what we have in Singapore. All in all, this trip was a marvelous experience and I would not mind going back to Vietnam.  - Gervin Tang, 3E1  <br><br>
During the recent oversea learning trip to Hanoi, my friends and I got to learn and have a better understanding of Vietnam’s history and culture. We also visited many places like the water puppet show and a local school where we had a taste of their education system.  - Goh Kai Qi, 3A2</p>
