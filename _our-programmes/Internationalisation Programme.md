### Internationalisation Programme

**Our belief in the programme**

Since 2018, one of the signature programmes for the entire secondary three cohort is the Overseas Learning Journey (OLJ) that marks the end of the academic year.  The school’s Internationalisation Programme belief is that it forms a part of our provision for a holistic education within the classroom and without.  As such, we are committed to provide every student with an opportunity to travel overseas with the school at least once in their 4-5 years of education with us.

**The objectives of Trips for International Experience (TIE)**

*   Deepen in our students the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities.
*   Expose students to Asia with a greater focus on ASEAN countries and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the world.
*   Strengthen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

In 2019, a total of 6 OLJ destinations were organised from Malaysia to Thailand, Vietnam and China.
