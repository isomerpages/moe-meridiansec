#### Extensive Reading Programme - #MeridianReads
At Meridian Secondary, we aim to awaken the inner reader in every Meridian. As the library is an oasis of knowledge and resources that opens up the imagination of our students, the English Language Department partnered the National Library Board in 2018 to revamp our school library.

Our teachers are reading models who promote extensive reading by giving Meridians the time, encouragement and books to read pleasurably, at their own level.<br>

We have a wide range of activities to encourage reading in our students this year. On top of regular visits to the library during curriculum time, activities include ‘Redesign a Book Cover’, ‘Book Fairy Giveaway’, ‘Go on a Blind Date with a Book’, ‘Print to Reel’, ‘Book Recommendation for you’.  Lower Secondary students can look forward to attaining the “Best Reader Award” by completing their reading logs as well.

To build a strong reading culture within our classrooms, we provided our Sec One classes with a classroom library each. They can customise their own classroom library and pick up the habit of reading through a good book selection.

#### English Language & Literature Week
			
To foster a love of the English Language in our students through different platforms and to celebrate the joy of reading and writing, the English Language & Literature Week features a number of activities to nurture creativity among the students. For example, there is a Book Character Dress Up Day for students to dress up and represent a character from a book they have read. For the Lower Sec, we also have a Spelling Bee Competition, and for the Upper Sec, a Creative Writing Competition. The English Language & Literature Week is always a buzzing week of exciting activities!

#### Advanced Elective Module (AEM)
During the March holidays, a group of selected Sec 3 students took part in Temasek Polytechnic’s Photojournalism and broadcasting module. They had fun learning the process in the creation of a radio programme. They fine-tuned their scripts, recorded their stinger, interviewed their guest and edited their podcast. Check out our Sec 3 students in action!</p>

#### Meridian Speakers Programme
The Meridian Speakers Programme aims to develop confident and eloquent speakers who are able to command the attention of their audience. Despite the reduction of face-to-face public speaking events, our Meridian Speakers have pivoted to speak online by hosting school outreach sessions as well as e-Open Houses. At the same time, our team have developed our very own podcast, The Meridian Show!</p>
