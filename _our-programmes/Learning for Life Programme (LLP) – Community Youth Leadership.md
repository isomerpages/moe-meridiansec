			<p>The school integrates the Five K&P Practices of Exemplary Leadership in developing student leaders.</p>
			<p>The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership® is a functional leadership model offered by James Kouzes and Barry Posner (1987) in their book, “The Leadership Challenge.” It reveals a cluster of behaviours identified through a thematic analysis of what people did when they were at their “personal best” in leading others. The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership are namely Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.</p>
