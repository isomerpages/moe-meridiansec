			<h3>DESIGN THINKING</h3>

			<p>In Meridian Secondary School, we have identified Design Thinking (DT) as one of the key programmes from 2017 onwards.</p>
			<h3>STUDENTS</h3>
			<p>Secondary 1 students will experience the DT process of ‘Feel’, ‘Think’ ‘Do’ and ‘Share’ through an in-house workshop conducted within the FCE lesson. To experience empathy (Feel), they will be given a scenario in which they have to re-enact. They will then brainstorm on possible solutions and create a prototype of their chosen solution.</p>
			<p>Thereafter, students will explain their chosen problem issue and prototype to their classmates. Classmates will then be given the opportunity to provide feedback on their friends’ prototypes.</p>
			<p>In using the DT process, users are required to apply several 21st Century Skills such as creative, adaptive thinking, decision making, new media literacy, empathy and cross-disciplinary competency by coming up with solutions to improve our current living environment and its processes. Through DT, Meridian Secondary aims to inspire learners to be innovative problem solvers and effective decision makers, equipping them effectively to face future challenges in the real world.</p>
			<p>DT will be incorporated progressively into the school processes and programmes for staff and students respectively. For students, the DT approach will be implemented in three main school programmes. The three programmes are Food and Consumer Education (FCE)/ Design & Technology (D&T) at Sec 1, Applied Learning Programe (ALP) at Sec 2, and Values-In-Action (VIA) at Sec 3 as these subjects and/school programmes lend themselves to the use of the DT process.</p>
