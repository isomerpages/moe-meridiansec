<h3>Anugerah Mendaki</h3>
<p>Our alumna, Nuha Omar Zohri-Kung, was featured in BERITAmediacorp in October.
She was awarded Anugerah Mendaki, an award to reward and recognize Malay/Muslim
students who have done exceptionally well academically. When she was studying&nbsp;
for her GCE ‘O’ Level, she learnt to manage her time well, persevering
through her studies while doing volunteer work. She is now studying in
Raffles Institution and is also providing free tuition to other children.</p>

<h3>2018</h3>
<p><strong>Congratulations! <br>Muhammad Nafis (Class of 2017)</strong>
</p>
<p>The inspiring story of our 2017 student, Muhammad Nafis, is featured in
Berita Harian (21 Jan 2018)</p>
<p>The sudden loss of his father at beginning of Sec 3 dealt a heavy blow
to Nafis. Furthermore, in the same year, his grandma had difficulty eating.
She would vomit and was hospitalized. Nafis wanted to help with the care
of his grandmother, so he sought permission to be excused from Football
CCA to attend to his grandma’s needs at home straight after school. Unfortunately,
in the following year when he was in Sec 4, his flat was burnt due to a
short circuit and he had to move to a temporary house.</p>
<p>All these difficulties and obstacles didn’t deter him. It made him study
harder as he didn’t want to disappoint his mother. He wants to go to TJC
and then move to university studying accounting. Finally he said that he’s
glad that he didn’t disappoint his mum with his O level results. He did
his best and he was very pleased with his achievements!</p>
