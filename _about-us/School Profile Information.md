Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Aesthetics offers a spread of enriched Arts-related programmes and experiences that equip students with the capacity to use different mediums of Art to creatively communicate powerful messages through musical instruments, videography, and photography. The Enhanced Art Programme (EAP), a special Art curriculum for selected students who demonstrate a high level of interest in visual art, provides these students with opportunities to learn a wide variety of art-making techniques from master artists and through overseas immersion programmes. A variety of Student Development Experiences (SDEs), such as our Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), Values-In-Action (VIA) and the Meridian Lighthouse programme (MLP) provide opportunities for students to grow in character, hone their leadership skills and serve the community through collaborative projects. The Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) empowers students’ self-directed and collaborative learning anywhere, anytime.
