**Verse One:**

Joyful learners, seeking knowledge,

Reaching for the highest star.

Gifted minds, adding value,

Building our community.

Let’s unite and keep it true.

Let Meridian guide us through.

We will strive with all our hearts

To make Meridian great.

Caring people, daring leaders,

Leading in the thoughtful path.

Sharing arts, touching hearts,

Enrich our humanity

To make Meridian great.

### **Meridian Family Song**

**Verse:**

Meridian,

You give us the key to discover.

Our dreams, our goals,

Through arts, our passion.

Meridian,

Guide to the tower of success.

Leading with love, serving others,

Doing our best.

**Chorus:**

This is the place where we belong,

Where we’ll be strong as we unite.

Reach for the grand horizon,

And soar above the sky (x2)

**Coda:**

Meridian’s where we belong,

Where we’ll be strong,

Here we belong (x3)
