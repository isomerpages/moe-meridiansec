## Our Emblem
![](/images/MERIDIAN%20CREST.jpg)
The school emblem is formed by the letter M for Meridian Secondary School and is designed with two adjoining peaks to represent the unity of Coral Secondary School and Siglap Secondary School.

The peaks stand tall and exude strength in solid foundations.

The silver, blue and green colours symbolise Innovation, Leadership and The Arts.  

The silver peaks symbolise an innovative environment to cultivate creative thinkers.

Supporting the silver peaks are two pillars in blue and green which retain the heritage of both schools.

The first pillar in blue symbolises Leadership and the other in green symbolises The Arts.

Together, they represent the strength and unity of Meridians to reach new heights.

**Verse One:**

Joyful learners, seeking knowledge,

Reaching for the highest star.

Gifted minds, adding value,

Building our community.

To make Meridian great.

Caring people, daring leaders,

Leading in the thoughtful path.

Sharing arts, touching hearts,

Enrich our humanity

**Chorus:**

Let’s unite and keep it true.

Let Meridian guide us through.
