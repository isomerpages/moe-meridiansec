**Extract from Zulhilmi Zul'irfan's interview with Berita**

School work is not a hindrance for Zulhilmi Zul'Irfan, a 17-year-old, to engage in extracurricular activities.

In addition to actively playing football and practising silat (a traditional martial art), Zulhimi is also diligent in participating in community work.

He began immersing himself in the field of silat at the age of 10.

Moreover, he has successfully clinched several medals, including a Gold medal at the Sarawak International Silat Championship.

In school, he carries the responsibility of being a student councillor at Meridian Secondary School.

To ensure effective time management, Zulhilmi informed our journalist, Nur Arina Ahmad Anis, that he creates a daily schedule.

"I aspire to become a youth worker because I enjoy work related to the community and youth. I draw inspiration from Ustaz Omar and Ustaz Syakir, from Darul Ghufran Mosque. They have exposed me to various activities related to the community and youth. They have also helped me become someone dedicated to the community. Therefore, I want to do the same," said Zulhilmi.

Due to his outstanding academic achievements and good character, making him well-liked by many, he was chosen as the school's valedictorian for his cohort.

Although he felt surprised and never expected to become the school's valedictorian, Zulhilmi stated that he was deeply moved by the recognition.

With his GCE 'O' Level examination results, Zulhilmi plans to pursue a Community Development course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
