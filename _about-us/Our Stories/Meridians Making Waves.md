<p>After a 4-3 loss to Queensway Secondary School in February, naysayers
had written off Meridian Secondary School’s chances of retaining their
B Division girls’ football title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But the defending champions were determined to prove them wrong
and went into the final on April 18 wanting revenge.</p>
<p>Brushing off their critics, Meridian claimed their second consecutive
title with a 4-3 win at the Jalan Besar Stadium, with forward Liyana Indah
Rickit bagging all four goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It continued the 14-year-old’s remarkable scoring run against Queensway
in finals. The bane of the girls in purple also bagged five in 2023 and
another two in 2022 in Meridian’s C Division triumphs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Said coach Fabio da Silva: “Liyana has a very huge ability, she’s
a very skilful player... We gave her the freedom to go and enjoy the game
– that’s what we see from the goals that she’s scored.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, with February’s result still fresh in the memory, there
were doubts that Liyana and Meridian’s run would continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Said captain Nisreen Aziz: “Everyone had said after our first loss
to Queensway, it was over for us. But we knew that we still had the chance
and we fought for our spot, we knew we deserved this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“So we put in the effort, we pushed through to win the final.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;But their route to victory was not without its challenges, as Meridian
staved off a late comeback from Queensway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Meridian dominated the early proceedings, with Liyana opening the
scoring in the 15th minute as she skipped past several Queensway defenders
before burying the ball from the edge of the penalty box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;She added a second 17 minutes later before making it 3-0 for Meridian
on the stroke of half-time, as she glided past Queensway’s defence once
again with some nifty footwork before side-footing the ball into the goal
from close range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Liyana did not take long to make an impact upon returning to the
pitch after the interval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After just three minutes, she latched on to a poor clearance by
a Queensway defender before firing into the back of the net, giving Meridian
a comfortable four-goal cushion with 38 minutes of the 70-minute match
elapsed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But several substitutions and a change of tactics by Queensway sparked
some life into the former B Division champions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Queensway striker Bernice Lim gave her side a reprieve with a slick
lob over Meridian’s goalkeeper in the 48th minute, before grabbing another
20 minutes later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A comeback looked likely as Queensway skipper Qarissa Putri Ramadhani
Zahary scored from an indirect free kick three minutes into stoppage time,
but Meridian hung on for the win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“We were losing focus (in the second half) and maybe we got a bit
complacent, but coach told us to be humble and continue playing, so that’s
just what we did,” said Liyana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Da Silva praised his charges for their perseverance, especially
with the nervy end to the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;He said: “I liked to see Queensway work very hard and come back
strong against us – 4-3 is a close game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“But I give credit to the team that worked very hard to keep the
victory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“I’m very happy with how the team performed. The whole year, they
focused on winning this competition.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;While there was pressure to retain the title after their maiden
triumph in 2023, da Silva was pleased with how his players managed the
added expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;He said: “Of course, there was the pressure to keep winning, but
we always tell them to enjoy the game, that’s the most important thing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Despite the loss, Queensway coach Dilwant Singh was encouraged by
his charges’ performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;He said: “Technically, they (Meridian) had better players than us,
but we had heart and it showed in the second half.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Heart, work rate and teamwork can do a lot of difference and the
kids wanted it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“That shows the character and desire the team has and we just have
to follow the same direction.”</p>

<p>In the last two years, Meridian Secondary School striker Muhammad Alfieyan
Jumahat struggled to get game time with his school’s football team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he continued to work his socks off during training and followed advice
from coach Fabio da Silva closely. His perseverance and dedication eventually
paid off as da Silva made him a regular starter this season.</p>
<p>On May 7, he repaid the coach’s faith in him by scoring against Victoria
School to give Meridian a 1-0 win in the B Division boys’ final at the
Jalan Besar Stadium.</p>
<p>Rising highest to head home Qylfie Ryan Fazlie’s free kick in the 11th
minute, Alfieyan’s goal sparked celebrations from their schoolmates and
was ultimately enough for Meridian to clinch their first B Division boys’
title.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old also finished as the team’s top scorer by accounting for
seven of their 18 goals in nine matches.</p>
<p>Alfieyan said: “I’ve improved a lot since I was in Secondary 2, when I
was just a benchwarmer. Now, I’m in the starting XI and the team’s top
scorer. I feel proud of myself, it’s a big achievement. For my goal to
be the winning goal for the team as well, I felt happy.”</p>
<p>Da Silva credited Alfieyan for stepping up to the plate. He said: “Some
players take a few years to adjust well to this level and he’s one of them.
He’s taken on the challenge and worked very hard to be who he is today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As a coach, that’s what I’m proud of. He follows my instructions well,
works very well to defend and attack, and had a good tournament.”</p>
<p>Meridian started more aggressively and were not afraid to put in sliding
challenges on Victoria’s players, who had no answer to their opponents’
defensive solidarity and struggled to create chances after conceding early.</p>
<p>Da Silva said the team worked on nullifying Victoria’s biggest threats
– counter-attacks, long balls and set pieces – throughout the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added: “We scored the first goal and knew they were going to put players
forward, so I give credit to the boys for their communication as everybody
worked together.”</p>
<p>Meridian captain Andry Akimi Mahmood said they deserved the win, having
learnt from their mistakes in a 1-0 loss to Victoria during the group stage
on Jan 29.</p>
<p>“We let the wingers run too much (then), so this time we did well watching
out for them,” he said. “We applied what we learnt today and defended well
as a team.”</p>
<p>He also praised the team’s mental fortitude, saying: “All of us gave 100
per cent and nobody backed down. We were focused and determined to finish
first.</p>
<p>“There are no words to describe how proud I am. None of us were tired,
no one was lazy or scared, we’re all confident. We knew Victoria were a
good team, so we wanted to start and end aggressive.”</p>
<p>Paying tribute to da Silva, Andry added: “It feels amazing to be the first
team to win Meridian the title, and I’m proud of the team and thankful
to coach for the achievement. He pushes us during every training, telling
us our mistakes and making us learn.”</p>
<p>Da Silva lauded his team’s effort in return, highlighting the work they
put in throughout the 80 minutes.</p>
<p>He said that at the start of the season, he had encouraged the team to
make history. Formed only in 2017, the team had previously come close when
they finished as runners-up.</p>
<p>“We made the school proud and I’m very happy for this group of players,”
he said.</p>
<p>Victoria skipper Xavier Tan admitted that it was simply not their day,
saying: “We couldn’t get together and gel as a team today... I’m proud
we made the final but I’m disappointed we fell short.”</p>

<p><strong>Extract from Zulhilmi Zul'irfan's interview with Berita</strong>
</p>
<p>School work is not a hindrance for Zulhilmi Zul'Irfan, a 17-year-old,
to engage in extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>In addition to actively playing football and practising silat (a traditional
martial art), Zulhimi is also diligent in participating in community work.</p>
<p>He began immersing himself in the field of silat at the age of 10.</p>
<p>Moreover, he has successfully clinched several medals, including a Gold
medal at the Sarawak International Silat Championship.</p>
<p>In school, he carries the responsibility of being a student councillor
at Meridian Secondary School.</p>
<p>To ensure effective time management, Zulhilmi informed our journalist,
Nur Arina Ahmad Anis, that he creates a daily schedule.</p>
<p>"I aspire to become a youth worker because I enjoy work related to the
community and youth. I draw inspiration from Ustaz Omar and Ustaz Syakir,
from Darul Ghufran Mosque. They have exposed me to various activities related
to the community and youth. They have also helped me become someone dedicated
to the community. Therefore, I want to do the same," said Zulhilmi.</p>
<p>Due to his outstanding academic achievements and good character, making
him well-liked by many, he was chosen as the school's valedictorian for
his cohort.</p>
<p>Although he felt surprised and never expected to become the school's valedictorian,
Zulhilmi stated that he was deeply moved by the recognition.</p>
<p>With his GCE 'O' Level examination results, Zulhilmi plans to pursue a
Community Development course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
