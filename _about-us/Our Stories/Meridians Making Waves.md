<p>In the last two years, Meridian Secondary School striker Muhammad Alfieyan
Jumahat struggled to get game time with his school’s football team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he continued to work his socks off during training and followed advice
from coach Fabio da Silva closely. His perseverance and dedication eventually
paid off as da Silva made him a regular starter this season.</p>

<p><strong>Extract from Zulhilmi Zul'irfan's interview with Berita</strong>
</p>
<p>School work is not a hindrance for Zulhilmi Zul'Irfan, a 17-year-old,
to engage in extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>In addition to actively playing football and practising silat (a traditional
martial art), Zulhimi is also diligent in participating in community work.</p>
<p>He began immersing himself in the field of silat at the age of 10.</p>
<p>Moreover, he has successfully clinched several medals, including a Gold
medal at the Sarawak International Silat Championship.</p>
<p>In school, he carries the responsibility of being a student councillor
at Meridian Secondary School.</p>
<p>To ensure effective time management, Zulhilmi informed our journalist,
Nur Arina Ahmad Anis, that he creates a daily schedule.</p>
<p>"I aspire to become a youth worker because I enjoy work related to the
community and youth. I draw inspiration from Ustaz Omar and Ustaz Syakir,
from Darul Ghufran Mosque. They have exposed me to various activities related
to the community and youth. They have also helped me become someone dedicated
to the community. Therefore, I want to do the same," said Zulhilmi.</p>
<p>Due to his outstanding academic achievements and good character, making
him well-liked by many, he was chosen as the school's valedictorian for
his cohort.</p>
<p>Although he felt surprised and never expected to become the school's valedictorian,
Zulhilmi stated that he was deeply moved by the recognition.</p>
<p>With his GCE 'O' Level examination results, Zulhilmi plans to pursue a
Community Development course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
