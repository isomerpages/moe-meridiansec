<p>&nbsp;On 6 February 2025, our Parent Support Group (PSG) came together
with our School Leaders and teachers for a lively Lunar New Year celebration.
It was an evening filled with warmth, laughter, and shared traditions,
where parents and staff deepened bonds and strengthened our sense of community.</p>
<p>The highlight of the event was the Lo Hei session, where everyone joined
in to toss for good fortune, unity, and success. Beyond the symbolic “prosperity
toss,” the activity reflected the collaborative spirit that keeps the Meridian
family moving forward together.</p>
<p>We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our PSG members for their
active participation, generosity, and steadfast support. Your involvement
continues to enrich the school experience for our students, and your partnership
reminds us that education is truly a shared journey. Together, we look
forward to another year of growth, positivity, and success at Meridian
Secondary School.</p>

rich tapestry of Singapore’s multicultural heritage.</p>
<p>Through these hands-on activities and shared experiences, students not
only had fun but also deepened their appreciation for the traditions and
cultures that shape our community. The buzz of excitement and laughter
