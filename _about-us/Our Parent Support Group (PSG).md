<p>On 21 February 2024, our Parent Support Group (PSG) gathered to celebrate
the Lunar New Year. Joined by the School Leaders and teachers, the PSG
members engaged in meaningful bonding activities that not only fostered
camaraderie but also strengthened their connection to the school community.</p>

The celebration culminated in a joyful Lohei session, symbolizing prosperity,
unity, and positivity for the year ahead—a fitting start to what promises
to be a successful and rewarding journey for all at Meridian Secondary

(PSG) members joined us in school to celebrate with our students. The PSG
brought along traditional snacks from different cultures, giving students
a chance to sample and enjoy treats that are cherished across Singapore’s
