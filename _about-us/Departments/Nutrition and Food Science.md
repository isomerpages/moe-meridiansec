### **FOOD AND CONSUMER EDUCATION (LOWER SECONDARY)**

The lower secondary Home Economics syllabus was revised and renamed Food and Consumer Education (FCE), and implemented in 2014. Aimed at empowering our students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers, FCE in the 21st century is designed with the current and future social and economic landscape of Singapore in mind. It takes into consideration new lifestyles and consumer trends, and therefore, the knowledge, skills and attitudes of young learners related to health and financial management. The focus of the FCE curriculum in Meridian Secondary School is to equip students with basic culinary skills, knowledge of nutrients and recipe modification for various diet-related diseases.

### **NUTRITION AND FOOD SCIENCE (UPPER SECONDARY)**

Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) is offered as an elective ‘O’ and ‘N’ Level subject for our upper secondary students.

The NFS syllabus provide students with a broad understanding of concepts in nutrition and health, food literacy and principles of food science. Students will be exposed to authentic real world contexts through hands-on practical and coursework. Through these learning experiences, the syllabus aims to develop students to:

*   lead a healthier lifestyle proactively through proper diet and nutrition;
*   advocate sustainable food consumption by planning and making appropriate food choices; and
*   apply principles of culinary science creatively in food preparation and cooking.

The assessment objectives are classified into three main areas:
