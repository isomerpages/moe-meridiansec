    <div>
      <p>The experiential nature of science through authentic learning tasks, performance tasks, experiments and projects cannot be dissected from the learning process of the subject area. Science lessons in Meridian Secondary School are conducted to elicit students’ sense of inquiry and discovery as well as to inculcate learning using all their senses. As part of the nation-wide Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our science tasks and activities are designed with the use of students’ personal learning devices to support their out-of-classroom Science teaching and learning experiences.</p>
			<h4>Transforming Teaching & Learning to ICT-based Lesson Packages</h4>
			<p>The Science department continues to develop lesson resources for bite-sized learning for both the lower and upper secondary Science levels. ICT and bite-sized checkpoints for Assessments for Learning (AfL) are conscientiously included with the aim of positive student outcomes.<br><br>
With the push for 21st Century Competencies (21CC), it is necessary to prepare students to be able to develop:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>effective communication</b>, sharing ideas and expressing opinions</li>
				<li><b>collaborative skills</b>through group work learning and project-based learning</li>
				<li>expose students to a variety of learning experiences especially the use of ICT tools since they are<b> digital learners.</b></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, a new area of focus this year would be the application of ICT-enabled lessons in our daily lessons, using the Design Thinking approach as well as the structure of <b>I Do, We Do, You Do</b> in the lesson to improve students’ confidence and attain achievement<br><br>
Our programmes aim to give students the experience of conducting investigative science projects and provide them with a platform for scientific exchange. Students will be given opportunities to be engaged in Science workshops, learning journeys and competitions at various Science institutions.<br><br>
The department continues to provide opportunities for students from all classes and streams to participate in external Science competitions.</p>
			<p><u>Framework:</u></p>
			<p>The Science Enrichment framework is modelled from the NE, “Head, Heart and Hands” framework.</p>

			<h4><u>Meridian Science Enrichment</u></h4>
			<p><b>Science Centre Workshops</b></p>
      <p>Our Sec 1 students were engaged in a Science Centre Singapore workshop called “The Science of Making Candy” during the Term 2 Week 10 Experiential Learning Programme. The students learned about the different types of sugar and how they are made into candies using interfering agents.</p>

			<h4>Learning Journey to Greensproutz and Kok Fah Technology Farm</h4>
			<p>All Sec 1 students went on a learning journey to Singapore’s modern agricultural farms as part of their Term 2 Week 10 Experiential Learning Programme. A few classes went on a tour at Kok Fah Technology Farm and learned the science behind hydroponics. The remaining classes went on a sustainable journey at Greensproutz to learn how recycled items are used to make terrariums. At the end of their learning journeys, students brought home new science knowledge and souvenirs!</p>

			<h4>Biology AEM: ApLM Discovering Pharmacy @ Temasek Polytechnic</h4>
			<p>Our Sec 3 Biology students had the opportunity to attend Temasek Polytechnic’s Discovering Pharmacy AEM during their March Holidays. In the 4-day course, they learned about the different types of medications, focusing on over-the-counter medications, principles of optimizing drug therapy as well as responsible and proper self-medication. The AEM introduces students to the products and services of a pharmacy and they get to know the industry through sharing conducted by industry practitioners and lecturers.</p>

			<h4>Science External Competitions</h4>
			<p><b>Singapore National Crystal Growing Competition</b></p>
			<p>The Singapore National Crystal Growing Competition is organised by the National University of Singapore for all secondary schools to encourage the learning and mastery in the art of crystal growing.<br><br>
Two students represented our school in the 15th Singapore National Crystal Growing Competition. Under the guidance of Mr Arthur Lee, they spent weeks in the planning and optimisation of their lab procedure for the growth of ammonium nickel (II) sulfate.</p>

			<p><b>STEM Playground Challenge</b></p>
			<p>The STEM Playground Challenge is part of the UNTAME Festival organised by the Singapore Science Centre and the James Dyson Foundation. Students use their knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics to apply into real-world situations.</p>
			<img src="/images/Science05.jpg" style="width:60%">
			<p>All Sec 2 students participated in the STEM Playground Challenge #2: Dome Sweet Dome, where they are tasked to build a geodesic dome using any materials. After building their domes, students have to test the support strength of the dome by stacking handphones! From each class, a winning entry with the strongest structure built with sustainable or recyclable materials was selected.</p>
