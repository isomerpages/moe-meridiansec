    <div>
      <p>The experiential nature of science through authentic learning tasks, performance tasks, experiments and projects cannot be dissected from the learning process of the subject area. Science lessons in Meridian Secondary School are conducted to elicit students’ sense of inquiry and discovery as well as to inculcate learning using all their senses. As part of the nation-wide Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our science tasks and activities are designed with the use of students’ personal learning devices to support their out-of-classroom Science teaching and learning experiences.</p>
			<h4>Transforming Teaching & Learning to ICT-based Lesson Packages</h4>
			<p>The Science department continues to develop lesson resources for bite-sized learning for both the lower and upper secondary Science levels. ICT and bite-sized checkpoints for Assessments for Learning (AfL) are conscientiously included with the aim of positive student outcomes.<br><br>
With the push for 21st Century Competencies (21CC), it is necessary to prepare students to be able to develop:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>effective communication</b>, sharing ideas and expressing opinions</li>
				<li><b>collaborative skills</b>through group work learning and project-based learning</li>
				<li>expose students to a variety of learning experiences especially the use of ICT tools since they are<b> digital learners.</b></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, a new area of focus this year would be the application of ICT-enabled lessons in our daily lessons, using the Design Thinking approach as well as the structure of <b>I Do, We Do, You Do</b> in the lesson to improve students’ confidence and attain achievement<br><br>
Our programmes aim to give students the experience of conducting investigative science projects and provide them with a platform for scientific exchange. Students will be given opportunities to be engaged in Science workshops, learning journeys and competitions at various Science institutions.<br><br>
The department continues to provide opportunities for students from all classes and streams to participate in external Science competitions.</p>
