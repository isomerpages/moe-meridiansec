    <label for="accordion3">Integrated Arts Programme</label>
    <div>
      <p>Through the “Integrated Arts Programme” (IAP), Secondary 1 students receive hands-on experience in various performing arts modules like gamelan, hip hop dance, and violin. The wide exposure aims to help students have a better understanding of the performing arts from local and global cultures, develop a range of ways for self-expression, develop their sense of creativity, and develop their collaborative skills.<br><br>
Feedback from Students:<br><br>
<i>“I learnt different dance moves and how to express myself through dance.”</i><br><br>
	<i>“I learnt that patience is required in order to play the instruments smoothly.”</i><br><br>
	<i>“I learn how important teamwork is in order to play the piece nicely.”</i></p>

    <label for="accordion4">Music Curriculum</label>
    <div>
      <p>Students at Meridian are provided with sound footing for an informed and life-long involvement in music. The MOE framework for teaching and learning music is closely followed in the planning of our curriculum. As such, students are given opportunities for a good balance of listening and responding to music, performing to music and creating their own music. Students are also provided with music literacy skills to aid them in communicating with others through music, and to express their musical thoughts. Collaborative learning and reflective thinking are strongly encouraged in class. When possible, students are provided with platforms to perform as a class for school events.<br><br>
At Secondary One, the emphasis is placed on training students’ listening skills. These listening activities will in turn inform them in their performance and creation of music. Above that, the Secondary Ones are equipped with basic instrumental skills on instruments such as the ukulele and keyboard.<br><br>
At Secondary Two, students go more in-depth with ensemble playing skills. This encourages close listening and good coordination of timing. To keep up with the times, the Secondary Twos also experience using Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) to create their individual musical works.<br><br>
We are proud to see highly motivated Meridians playing music during their free time, and whom are also happy to share their music with the school. Follow @meridian_channel on Instagram to find some of their works.</p>

      <p>The school assembly programmes serve as a platform of exposure to the school population. At Meridian, this is used to expose all students to a variety of art forms (e.g. dance, drama, music). These programmes are selected to encourage Meridians to pursue their interest and participation in the arts.</p>

      <p>Other than developing a sense of camaraderie and pride in the Meridian community via the singing of the Meridian Family song, the “Project Family Song” also aims to give all Meridians a platform to lead through performing. It is important to us that all students are provided with the opportunity to perform and lead others through their performance. Through this, students build confidence and develop an awareness of good presentation skills.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The “Aesthetics Learning Journey” aims to help students appreciate art, music and Physical Education from the Singapore culture. As such, the locations (i.e. Haji Lane and Telok Ayer) that were carefully selected are places that are rich in history and culture. Students learn to navigate the area in small groups and are engaged in station activities. Through the activities, they have a better understanding of the various cultures in Singapore and how the past relates to the present.<br><br>
Feedback from Students:<br><br>
<i>“It was fun to experience the past in the form of art and music.”</i><br><br>
<i>“I was able to see the beauty and art in the culture of Singapore”</i>

      <p>The learning journeys and workshops allow students to be exposed to a range of performing arts, experience them in their real settings (e.g. in theatre studio or concert halls), and explore performing arts venues in Singapore. Some of these learning journeys are conducted in collaboration with the “Keppel Nights” programme. In addition, students learn to observe proper concert etiquette.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The “Meridian Artistes” programme is a platform to recognize passionate, innovative, excellent and resilient performing arts leaders. These students may be performing arts CCA leaders or have participated actively in and/or outside of school. Their roles as Meridian Artistes are to coordinate performing arts programmes in school (e.g. Speech Day performances) or suggest ideas to promote the performing arts in school.<br><br>
The Meridian Artistes mission is to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>provide and promote quality and innovative performing arts performances</li>
				<li>develop a positive, healthy, and collaborative performing arts community in Meridian</li>
				<li>inspire and delight the local community</li>

To assist students in exploring future career options, our school has been actively collaborating with tertiary institutes (e.g. Singapore Polytechnic, NAFA and Laselle) to provide students with a taster of tavailable courses.<br><br>
We are heartened to see alumni students doing well in the performing arts scene. Some have also done their part in giving back to the community.</p>

      <p>In-house talent competitions and external platforms are organized for students to hone their skills. The JAM (Joyful and Artistic Meridians) talent competition is our in-house competition which has increasingly been receiving popular signup rates by students. Guest judges with accomplished portfolios are often brought in during the finals to increase the level of professionalism expected. With regard to external platforms, performances at external venues are organized when possible and students have represented the school at several East Zone and national competitions. The national competitions include the National Xinyao Singing Competition organized by CPCLL, the SYF Youth Station, and the SYF Evolution!
