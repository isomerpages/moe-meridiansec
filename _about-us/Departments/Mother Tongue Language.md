    <div>
      <p>The Meridian MTL curriculum is one that marries the central MTL syllabus with that of our school-based curriculum. The department constantly explores formative assessments as scaffolds to support students’ progression in learning and henceforth to better bridge students’ targets to summative assessments.</p>

<p>Through the experience that explores differentiated strategies customized to enhance the three core focuses of teaching and learning MTL, namely Skills Acquisition & Enhancement, Cognitive Thinking and Authentic Experiential Learning, we hope to develop our students holistically as caring, creative, and confident individuals.</p>
