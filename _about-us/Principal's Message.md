> *“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.”*   - Socrates

I started my last message in my previous school with the exact same quote, because it is still so apt for Meridian. Apt, because after 5 years of uniting the school, and empowering the community to reach new heights, Mrs Hilda Thong has moved on to continue her good work as Principal of Katong Convent. She has led the school through an eventful journey – from the initial trepidation of forging a new identity, through the excitement of sustaining both new and old ventures, and finally, over the last 2 years, navigating the challenges of COVID19 – all while ensuring that the school continues to serve its purpose. Team Meridian is forever indebted to her vision, foresight and care for the community.

What then, is the purpose of school? A school, first and foremost, is a place of learning. For it to be the best place for a child to learn, two simple ideas must be propagated by the community. One, that it must provide positive learning experiences so that the learners become better persons for others; and two, that when these learners leave the school, they have the keys to open many doors in life.

In Meridian, these two simple ideas are encapsulated in our mission to nurture in Meridians, inquiring minds and caring hearts for their pursuit of excellence. Through the Meridian experience, the members of the community will be imbued with the spirit of creativity to not only learn joyfully, but also to lead compassionately. They will have the resilience to “go again”, even if on the first “go”, they did not succeed. And when they have earned the keys to unlock their success, they will not only take pride that they have done so with integrity, but will also have the humility to recognize that they had a whole team behind them, and that they never walked alone.

As 2022 beckons, I congratulate the 2021 graduating Meridians for completing their journey with the school. The N level students received their results in December, and if you have done your best, and had nothing left to give, then you should be proud of the results that you received. If not, you still have a long and purposeful road ahead of you, and the choices that you make, will still make a difference in the lives that you can lead.

I have shared two simple ideas, but simple ideas have this quite anarchic way of being deviously difficult to achieve. Sometimes we develop practices which complicate rather than streamline processes, or we create processes which constrict rather than facilitate positive action. At other times, we put in place structures which drive our behaviours in ways that divert us from our purpose. I hope to be able to help the Meridian community to streamline good practices and facilitate positive actions, so that the progress that the community has made can be sustained, and everyone can feel that they had a part to play in that progress.

I started this message with wise words from Socrates. I would like to end with an adaptation of those same words:

> “The secret of change is to focus your energy, not on harking or wishing for the old. The secret of change is to focus on building the new. But equally important, the secret of change, is in appreciating, and learning from the old.”
