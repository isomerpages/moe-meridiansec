<p>Meridian Secondary turns 9 in 2025. Not many years ago, turning 9 in Singapore
was a significant milestone. From <a href="https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=0c0e8e39-538d-45d6-b952-abf22b4a65f8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1979 to 1991</a>,
students were streamed to 3 different courses at the end of Primary Three.
Long story short, some of us who grew up in that system had friends who
were in Primary 8 when they took the PSLE, or took a different exam called
the Primary School Proficiency Examination. That system has of course evolved.
We now leverage on Subject-Based Banding (SBB) where students, at different
stages of their education, are able to offer subjects at different demand
levels corresponding to their readiness. SBB builds on the strengths of
streaming – students take subjects at the level they are able to experience
success, while enabling porosity – even as it seeks to remove the stigma
of labelling that streaming has become synonymous with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We welcome 292 Sec 1 students in 2025. They join the 2024 cohort
as the first two cohorts to not only experience <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/schools-offering-full-sbb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">full subject-based banding but to sit for the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examination</a> at
the end of their Secondary Four year. The SEC exam will comprise different
papers for each subject level, similar to the current A-Level examination,
in which students take subjects at H1, H2, and H3 levels; and the PSLE,
where students take subjects at standard or foundation levels. These students
will receive an SEC that reflects the subjects and subject levels that
students offer.</p>
<p>Not only systems evolve, but societies and generations, too. Every student
cohort is different, and every school will continue to adapt its processes
to provide them with positive school experiences that develop them to become
better persons for others and give them the keys to open many doors when
they leave. Sound academic foundations and strong social-emotional competencies
are core, but the programmes and structures to build them need to evolve.
In Meridian, we are proud to continue building our strengths in sports,
leadership and the aesthetics, while exposing our students to a myriad
of activities to stretch their potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Equally necessary, the significant adults in the students’ lives
will also need to evolve in the way they build quality relationships, both
with the students, and amongst themselves. To facilitate the former and
as part of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, MOE has
worked with the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Health Promotion
Board to develop <a href="https://file.go.gov.sg/pfw-toolbox-for-parents.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parenting for Wellness</a>.
This is an initiative, announced at <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20240918-supporting-our-teachers-and-parents-through-refreshed-guidelines-for-school-home-partnership-and-new-parenting-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE’s Workplan Seminar 2024</a>,
to empower parents with key knowledge and skills to build strong parent-child
relationships, strengthen their children's mental well-being and resilience,
and parent effectively in the digital age.</p>
<p>For the latter, <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/press/2024/annex-b---engagement-charter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE's Engagement Charter</a> complements
the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20190216-guidelines-for-school-home-partnership-preparing-students-for-the-future" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Guidelines for School-Home Partnership</a> developed
in 2019. Students learn from the way adults interact and nurture their
own relationships. And these documents seek to strengthen this pillar and
help both staff and parents role model the right values and behaviours
in our students. When all the adults practice mutual courtesy and respect
as encapsulated in the charter, we will ensure not only a safe work environment
for staff to thrive in but also lead to an eco-system that fosters both
purposeful individual agency and collective community excellence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As Meridian approaches it’s 10<sup>th</sup> year, there is no doubt
that our community, our country, the world and life itself, will continue
to evolve. But unlike the cliché of evolution being a process of survival
of the fittest, we believe that evolution should enable all to flourish
in their individual uniqueness. It is that uniqueness that will strengthen
the collective fabric of society. We should all strive for that.</p>
<p>Yours-in-Education,</p>
