<p>I am Mr Puah You Kai, the new Principal of Meridian Secondary School.
I am deeply humbled to join the Meridian Family as its third Principal
and honoured to take over the leadership baton from Mr Mohamad Razali.</p>
<p>Meridian Secondary School was established in April 2016 through the union
of two schools in Pasir Ris: Siglap Secondary School and Coral Secondary
School. Since our inception, we have been clear-eyed in our mission as
a hope-building school for the community – providing all our students with
deep care, instilling in them sound values, and developing in them the
right mindsets, skillsets and toolsets to thrive long after they leave
us.</p>
<p>Every parent and child aspires to find a school that cares deeply, provides
an inspiring and meaningful education, and opens doors to future opportunities.
At Meridian, we are committed to being that school. We develop Meridians
to become Joyful Learners, Creative Thinkers and Compassionate Leaders,
anchored on our RICH values of Resilience, Integrity, Compassion and Humility.</p>
<p>Despite our short history, we have made significant strides. Some of our
students have been featured in the press for their <a href="https://www.meridiansec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/our-stories/meridians-making-waves/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">accomplishments</a>,
while countless others continue to make us proud in their own unique ways.
Many alumni remain in touch, and their continued development reinforces
our holistic education approach – nurturing their character, creativity
and resilience alongside their intellectual growth.</p>
<p>Since joining the school, I have connected with students, parents, alumni,
SAC members, CCA coaches and various community partners who shared fond
memories and a strong belief in what Meridian stands for. At the same time,
they also expressed concerns about the challenges facing our youths today
– from mental health pressures, to navigating relationships and peer dynamics,
to thriving in a digital world increasingly shaped by social media and
AI. Their stories have reinforced my conviction that we are building something
truly special, but also reminded me that more than ever, we need to work
more closely together as a school community to prepare our young for the
future.</p>
<p>Our school’s 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2026 will be a meaningful opportunity
to do just that – to honour those who have helped us get here, celebrate
our achievements, and strengthen our partnerships as we welcome the dreams
of past, present and future Meridians. I look forward to connecting more
deeply with members of our Meridian Family, as we celebrate and chart the
next bound of our growth together.</p>
<p>Wishing all a fruitful 2026 ahead!</p>
<p>Mr Puah You Kai
