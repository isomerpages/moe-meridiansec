<p><strong>RELEASE OF RESULTS</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The N-Level results will be released on:</p>
<p>Date: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, 16 December 2024.</p>
<p>Time: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arrangements have been made for students
to receive their results from 2.00pm onwards</p>
<p>Attire: &nbsp; Students must be in proper school attire and personal grooming
to receive their results.</p>
<p>Venue:&nbsp; School Hall</p>
<p>Note: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who are not in proper school attire
and personal grooming can collect their results from the form teachers
in the General Office between 3.15 pm to 3.45 pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return
to school to collect their results.</p>
<p>Students who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s
verification when collecting the results. You may contact the school for
assistance with the appointment of a proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>INVITATIONS TO PARENTS / GUARDIANS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Parents / Guardians are invited to be present during
the release of results. The school will be opened from 1.45 pm onwards.
If there are insufficient parking spaces in the school compound, parents
/ guardians can park their vehicles at the nearby HDB car parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Invited parents are reminded to take images (photos/videos) or post
images on social media of your own child / ward only. Please respect the
privacy of our students by refraining from taking or posting images of
other students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know
that they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define
them or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will
be especially valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions
and be positive when deciding on their next steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Do take this opportunity to have further open conversations with
your teen about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.</p>
