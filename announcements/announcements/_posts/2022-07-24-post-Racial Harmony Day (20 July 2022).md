Dear Meridians,

Racial Harmony Day is a day where we celebrate our diverse cross-cultural characteristics and reflect on the importance of fostering harmony and understanding amongst all communities in our nation. To commemorate this day, students are encouraged to wear their traditional/ethnic clothes to school on 20 July 2022 (Wednesday). Please refer to the following briefing slides for more details.
