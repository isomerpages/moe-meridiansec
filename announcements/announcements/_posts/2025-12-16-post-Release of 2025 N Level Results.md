<h2>RELEASE OF GCE N-LEVEL EXAM RESULTS</h2>
<p>The N-Level results will be released on:</p>
<p>Date: &nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday, 18 December 2025.</p>
<p>Time: &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.00 pm. Students should be seated in the School Hall
by 1.45 pm.</p>
<p>Attire: &nbsp; Students must be in proper school attire and personal grooming
to receive their results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Venue:&nbsp; School Hall</p>
<p>Students who are not in proper school attire and personal grooming, separate
arrangements will be made for the collection of their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They may be directed to a different venue and collection timing may be
affected.</p>
<p>Students who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to
school to collect their results.</p>
<p>Students who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification
when collecting the results. You may contact the school for assistance
with the appointment of a proxy.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>INVITATION TO PARENTS / GUARDIANS</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents / Guardians are invited to be present during the release of results.
The school will be open from 1.30 pm onwards. As there are insufficient
parking spaces in the school compound, parents / guardians are advised
to park their vehicles at the nearby HDB car parks.</p>
<p>Parents are reminded to respect the privacy of our students by refraining
from taking or posting images of other students.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;take
images (photos/videos) or post images on social media of your own child
/ ward only.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know that
they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define them
or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially
valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions and be
positive when deciding on their next steps.</p>
<p>Do take this opportunity to have further open conversations with your
child about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.</p>
