<h4>Sec 1 Code for Fun Programme 2025</h4>
<p>As part of the school's Experiential Week on 25 and 26 March 2025, our
Secondary 1 students participated in the Code for Fun programme—an engaging
programme that introduces students to computational thinking, inventive
problem-solving, and digital making through AI. This year's theme, Sustainable
Living, encouraged students to apply their learning to real-world challenges.</p>
<h4>Introducing Computational Thinking</h4>
<p>The programme kicked off with a hands-on paper house folding activity,
where students followed a set of step-by-step instructions. This exercise
mirrored the logic of coding, where a programmer writes a sequence of commands
for a computer to execute. Though this task, students experienced how clear
and structured instructions lead to the desired outcome, reinforcing the
need for precise thinking and problem-solving. This activity laid the foundation
for systematic thinking, a key skill in coding and problem-solving.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Departments/Mathematics 2025/pic1.jpg">
</div>
<h4>Hands-On Coding with Micro:bit</h4>
<p>Next, students delved into coding with the Micro:bit, experimenting with
input and output devices like buttons, sensors, LEDs, and motors. They
creatively applied their knowledge by simulating real-world scenarios,
such as programming the Micro:bit to mimic an ambulance with flashing red
and blue emergency lights and a heart display. Additionally, students used
the buttons on the Micro:bit to turn a fan on and off, showing how coding
can interact with everyday appliances. This hands-on experience helped
students understand how technology can solve real-world problems through
practical applications.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Departments/Mathematics 2025/Picture2.jpg">
</div>
<h4>Digital Making for a Greener Home</h4>
<p>The final challenge was the Digital Making Project, where students used
the Design Thinking process to tackle sustainability issues at home. They
began by identifying everyday problems, such as excessive electricity usage,
and then brainstormed innovative solutions. For example, many students
created automated sensors for household appliances like lights, fans, and
air conditioners, using coding to program the sensors to activate or deactivate
based on room occupancy or environmental conditions. This process involved
designing, prototyping, and writing code that allowed the devices to function
more efficiently, reducing waste. Through this project, students not only
applied their coding skills but also gained valuable insight into how technology
can contribute to sustainable living in real-world settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;Overall, the Code for Fun programme provided our Secondary 1 students
with an enriching and purposeful introduction to coding and digital innovation.
Beyond learning a technical skill, students tapped into their creativity,
practised critical thinking, and tackled real-world problems. By addressing
sustainability challenges through hands-on projects, they learned the importance
of using technology responsibly and meaningfully. The experience not only
sparked curiosity in digital making but also empowered students to become
thoughtful innovators who can shape a more sustainable future.</p>

<h3>2021</h3>
<h4>Sec 2 Virtual Learning Journey – Gardens by the Bay</h4>
<p>This year, the Sec 2s experienced a virtual Math Learning Journey to Gardens
by the Bay on 6 September 2021 from 0900 to 1430. It aims to enhance their
learning of Maths beyond the classroom by applying what they have learned
to real-life examples, through a virtual tour using Thinklink and SLS.
During the tour, students had to solve problems in the two indoor conservatories,
namely Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
<br>
<br>Students had the opportunity to apply mathematical skills in real-world
contexts, for example, analyse patterns and shapes, estimate measurements
using mathematical-modeling techniques, and calculate ticket prices using
financial literacy skills.
<br>
<br>Students from each level who presented the best solutions to the problems
are awarded prizes.
<br>
<br>The winners are:</p>

<h4>Meridian Mathematics and Financial Literacy Week</h4>
<p>Meridian Mathematics and Financial Literacy Week is a week-long celebration
from 8th&nbsp;to 12th&nbsp;March 2021. During the week, students across
the levels were engaged through a series of exciting and engaging activities
pertaining to Mathematics, POA and Financial Literacy.
<br>
<br>The highlights of the week include mathematical challenges such as Riddles,
Sudoku, and Tangrams in which students had to pit against one another in
solving challenging Math problems and puzzles. Sec 3 students also experienced
Math Modelling and Kite Making in which they applied Mathematics to real-life
scenarios.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:75%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/math%202021.png">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The students had positive learning experiences in the week and learned
how to connect better with Mathematics. Some also had the opportunity to
learn and apply concepts and skills to solve real-world problems, as well
as collaborate and work together as a team. Active participation was evident
in all levels, making the week an exciting an engaging experience for all!</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>During the week, Sec 3 students also played the Principles of Accounts
(POA) Business Challenge. The board game gave Sec 3 POA students an introductory
experience in managing a business. It provided a simulated business environment
that required players to carry out business transactions and make the correct
decisions to maximise their profits.</p>
