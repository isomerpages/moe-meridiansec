<h2><strong>English Department</strong></h2>
<h4>·&nbsp;Meridian Speakers Programme</h4>
<h4>·&nbsp;Extensive Reading Programme</h4>
<p>The English Department nurtures students' communication skills and literary
appreciation through two key pathways: the <strong>Meridian Speakers Programme and the Extensive Reading Programme.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Meridian Speakers Programme develops students' oracy skills through
a broad-based approach across Secondary 1 to 3, culminating in debate at
Secondary 3. This systematic progression builds students' confidence in
verbal communication and critical thinking. Selected students who audition
to become Meridian Speakers receive advanced opportunities to host school
events and conduct outreach at primary schools, developing their leadership
and public speaking abilities whilst serving the wider community.</p>
<p>The Extensive Reading Programme cultivates students' love for literature
and enhances their language proficiency through regular exposure to diverse
texts. English lessons conducted in the library environment, complemented
by engaging library activities, create an immersive reading culture that <strong>broadens students' literary horizons and deepens their appreciation for language.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the Meridian Speakers Programme, students develop into <strong>articulate and confident communicators, </strong>learning
to express their ideas clearly and persuasively whilst engaging thoughtfully
with different perspectives through debate and discussion.</p>
<p>Through the Extensive Reading Programme, students become discerning readers
and effective writers, expanding their vocabulary, enhancing their comprehension
skills, and developing critical thinking abilities as they engage with
varied literary works and genres.</p>
<p>Through this comprehensive approach, the English Department's programmes
shape students who <strong>communicate with clarity and confidence, think critically about complex issues, and demonstrate a lifelong appreciation for language and literature.</strong>
