<p>At Meridian Secondary, Art is for every student. Our curriculum builds <strong>visual literacy</strong>, <strong>creative confidenc</strong>e,
and <strong>art appreciation</strong>, equipping learners to think critically
and communicate effectively through art.</p>
<p>We offer Lower Secondary Art (Sec 1-2) as the foundation, followed by
Upper Secondary Art (Sec 3-5) at three levels (G1, G2, G3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Lower Secondary Art Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>At lower secondary, the curriculum equips students with key competencies
to <strong>observe and inquire</strong>, <strong>create and innovate</strong>,
and <strong>connect and respond</strong> to artworks around them.</p>
<p>Guided by three big ideas – <em>Art helps us see in new ways</em>; <em>Art tells stories about our world</em>; <em>Art influences how we live</em> –
students explore the form, content, and function of art and its relevance
to life.</p>
<p>Through a wide range of traditional and digital media, students broaden
their understanding of art and exercise choice in selecting media for their
own artmaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Upper Secondary Art Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>At upper secondary, the curriculum builds on foundational skills from
Lower Secondary Art and develops students into more independent and reflective
learners. Students are encouraged to form personal inquiries, experiment
with ideas, and refine their artistic decisions through deeper engagement
with art.</p>
<p>Depending on their subject level (G1, G2, or G3), students experience
different levels of breadth and depth in their learning. They work with
a wider range of art forms – including drawing, design, digital imaging,
and time-based media – and apply <strong>visual strategies</strong>, <strong>design concepts</strong>,
and <strong>contextual understanding</strong> to explore real-world issues.</p>
<p>Through building portfolios, art journaling, and art conversations, students
strengthen their ability to <strong>observe, imagine, and create with confidence and purpose,</strong> preparing
them for national examinations and future pathways in the arts.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Showcase</strong></h4>
<p>Our students express their ideas through a wide range of art forms, reflecting
creativity, imagination, and growing confidence, The artworks featured
here are just a glimpse of what they have explored in their learning journey.</p>
