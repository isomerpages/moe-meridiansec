### Vision
The Humanities department in Meridian Secondary School aims to develop “Concerned Citizens, Independent Learners” through the discipline of Geography, History and Social Studies. Students will be prepared to contribute as active citizens through the acquisition of critical thinking skills and development of an inquiring mind.

### Approach
The Humanities department employs an inquiry-based approach as its main pedagogy to encourage critical thinking and problem solving. Students will be required to embark on an inquiry process where they investigate, analyse, and consolidate information, and draw conclusions to the questions based on evidence. In the process, students will also be encouraged to share their conclusions with their peers, and to critique and refine their own and others’ work through pair, group and/or class discussions and through individual reflections. Geographical and historical investigations through field-based and experiential learning offer opportunities for students to engage in the inquiry process.

### Assessment

Assessment in the Humanities curriculum includes Assessment for Learning and Assessment of Learning to facilitate meaningful learning and encourage independent learning. Modes of assessment include geographical and historical investigation, source-based questions and summative assessment carried out in the form of level tests or examinations. Authentic assessment tasks through geographical and historical investigations also encourage students to showcase their varied intelligences so that our assessment of our students will be accurate and holistic.



### Highlights
#### Developing Geographical knowledge and skills

Through the study of Geography, we strive to develop our students into confident persons who are discerning in judgment, able to think independently and critically and communicate effectively. He/ She is also a self-directed learner and an active contributor who is able to work in teams and strives for excellence. In Meridian, fieldwork activities is one platform where such attributes are nurtured. In teams, students are actively engaged in inquiry related to their chosen environmental issue. They formulate hypotheses, collect, analyse and present data collected using appropriate presentation tools. Our lower secondary students had investigated issues related to tropical forests and housing while upper secondary students had focussed on neighbourhood and tourism in Singapore. For greater exposure and application of their learning, students also participate in national competitions.

#### Developing Historical knowledge and skills 

In Meridian, History students are actively engaged through various activities to develop them into confident, self-directed, critical and reflective thinkers.  From involving them in historical inquiry that provides them with platforms to conduct authentic historical research beyond the classroom, to helping them acquire knowledge and understanding of how the past has been interpreted through a study and discussion of artefacts via museum visits and giving them exposure in competitions to deepen their understanding of and sharpening their ability to apply their historical knowledge and skills to make inter-connections with what they have learnt.

#### Developing critical thinking through Social Studies  

**Meridian One Hack at A Time [OHAT] 2023**<br>
One Hack at A Time is a Meridian Secondary Humanities Department flagship collaboration event launched with two other schools two years ago. In this Social Hackathon, selected students were challenged to design innovative solutions to contemporary issues surrounding governance and citizenship in Singapore. This year, we decided to extend this experience to all our Secondary 3 students as part of our Social Studies curriculum. We believe that the 21st CC learner is also a highly collaborative player. In line with our efforts to groom our students to be Active Citizens who can collaborate with others, they investigated the causes and impacts of contemporary issues in Singapore and suggested strategies to address these societal concerns in groups.

**Reflecting on an Incredible Term 2: Our Social Hackathon Journey**<br> 
What a whirlwind of creativity, collaboration, and impact! The Secondary 3 Social Studies students came together for an unforgettable social hackathon, where ideas turned into innovations and passion fueled purpose. Students were given various prompts in which they were challenged to innovate and design a solution to tackle prominent social challenges that Singapore faces today. Solutions had to take into account the needs of stakeholders while still meeting the needs of the nation. The best groups from various classes were invited to compete in a final session where they pitched to our humanities judges!

**Survivor Singapore**<br>
On 5th July, 40 Upper Secondary Meridians had the opportunity to watch the play "Survivor Singapore" which invited us to think more deeply about Singapore's issues and how we can play a part in shaping Singapore's future. At the end of the play, we were invited to dialogue with the actors and director on the social issues the play touched on which allowed us to understand deeper the themes of the play.
