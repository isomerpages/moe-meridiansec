### Our Approach

The Meridian Music curriculum aims to promote lifelong and lifewide music learning through nurturing the innate musical ability in every student. With the wide range of programmes offered, students are given opportunities to discover, collaborate, and find the joy of music.

The school covers Stage 4 of the Primary and Lower Secondary Music syllabus over a 2-year programme. All Secondary 1 and 2 students will develop musical skills, knowledge, and understanding for creative expression and communication through the modular programme.

#### Listening, Creating and Performing

Students develop musical skills in listening, creating and performing as they delve into the various modules: rhythm studies, ukulele, keyboard, music arrangement using music technology (BandLab), and guitar. While engaging in these musical learning experiences, students also develop character and positive collaborative relationships with others.

#### Music Appreciation

All Secondary 1 students will be exposed to music from other cultures by engaging with local musicians during the violin or gamelan programme. These learning experiences will allow them to explore their national identity and have an appreciation for the various arts in Singapore.

### Beyond the Music Classroom

Authentic learning opportunities beyond the music classroom are provided to complement, reinforce and stretch students’ classroom-based learning.

#### Within School

Within school, students are provided with opportunities to attend workshops and masterclasses (e.g. song production workshop and piano festival), participate in the school’s in-house talent competition (i.e. JAM), and give back to the school community through performances at school events.

Other than opportunities that are provided for all, selected students are inducted into the Meridian Artistes programme to develop self-directed arts leaders who inspire their schoolmates’ in music and the arts. In 2022, the Meridian Artistes took the initiative to propose and organize the combined Band and Choir performance.

#### Beyond School
Beyond school, students are connected and directed to avenues to further nurture their talents and interests. With their strong passion and love for learning, our students have been featured at the ChildAid 2022, SYF Youth Station, and the Youth Station Project interview for the Teachers’ Conference and ExCEL Fest (TCEF).
