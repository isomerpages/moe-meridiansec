<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The Meridian Music curriculum aims to promote lifelong and lifewide music
learning through nurturing the innate musical ability in every student.
With the wide range of programmes offered, students are given opportunities
to discover, collaborate, and find the joy of music.</p>
<h4>1. Music Curriculum</h4>
<p>The school covers Stage 4 of the Primary and Lower Secondary Music syllabus
over a 2-year programme. All Secondary 1 and 2 students will develop musical
skills, knowledge, and understanding for creative expression and communication
through the modular programme.</p>
<h4>Listening, Creating and Performing</h4>
<p>Students develop musical skills in listening, creating and performing
as they delve into the various modules: rhythm studies, ukulele, keyboard,
music arrangement using music technology (BandLab), and guitar. While engaging
in these musical learning experiences, students also develop character
and positive collaborative relationships with others.</p>

<h4>Music Appreciation</h4>
<p>All Secondary 1 students will be exposed to music from other cultures
by engaging with local musicians during the violin or gamelan programme.
These learning experiences will allow them to explore their national identity
and have an appreciation for the various arts in Singapore.

<h4>2. Beyond the Music Classroom</h4>
<p>Authentic learning opportunities beyond the music classroom are provided
to complement, reinforce and stretch students’ classroom-based learning.</p>
<h4>Within School</h4>
<p>Within school, students are provided with opportunities to participate
in performances at school events.</p>

<h4>Beyond School</h4>
<p>Beyond school, students are connected and directed to avenues to further
nurture their talents and interests. With their strong passion and love
for learning, our students have been featured at the ChildAid 2022, SYF
Youth Station, and the Youth Station Project interview for the Teachers’
Conference and ExCEL Fest (TCEF).
