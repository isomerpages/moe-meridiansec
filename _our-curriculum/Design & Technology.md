<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our D&amp;T curriculum includes a variety of learner-centred activities
for our students to better understand concepts. There is a progression
from teacher-controlled structured projects at lower secondary to pupil-driven
open-ended projects at upper secondary.</p>
<p>For our lower secondary curriculum, students will get to learn the skills
required through specially crafted "Design-and-Make" projects. These projects
are guided by the design process which entails identifying design needs
from real-world experiences. Emphasis is being placed on the development
of students’ freehand sketching skills and students are also taught the
techniques to generate ideas. Students will acquire related knowledge and
develop skills to turn ideas into reality which makes their learning meaningful.</p>
<p>For the Secondary 3 level, the students will embark on project tasks which
are pupil-driven open-ended project. Through the projects, students are
required to conduct their own research and consolidate findings to solve
real-world ill-defined problems.</p>
<p>Our D&amp;T curriculum aims to help our students to grow the confidence
in sketching and making to create and innovate. They will acquire the necessary
skills to explore real world design opportunities and develop ideas to
solve problems.</p>

<h4>2024</h4>
<p><strong>D&amp;T Awards 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Congratulations to our alumni Sharmaine See (Class
of 2023) whose O-Level D&amp;T project "Droplets of Nature" had won the
D&amp;T Award 2024 (Creative Adaptation) organised by MOE, NIE and DTES.
The D&amp;T Award recognises and celebrates outstanding achievements of
students who demonstrates adaptive and inventive thinking in the design
of their D&amp;T prototypes. "Droplets of Nature" focus on sustainability
issue, designed to collect rainwater to water plants in 3 aesthetically
pleasing mushroom-shaped pots, utilising an adapted watering system. Well
done Sharmaine!</p>

<p><strong>Design Thinking – Working on Authentic Problem Situations</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sec 3 students also applied design thinking skills as they crafted
their own design brief and worked on solving real-life problem situations.</p>

<p>Students applied the concepts that they had learnt in class to design
and make a model bridge that can satisfy a given set of criteria.&nbsp;
The competition offers the students a “real-world” experience and they
got to witness how their bridges fared during the testing process.</p>
