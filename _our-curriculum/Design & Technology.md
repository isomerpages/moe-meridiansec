### Our Approach

Our D&T curriculum includes a variety of learner-centred activities for our students to better understand concepts.  There is a progression from teacher-controlled structured projects at lower secondary to pupil-driven open-ended projects at upper secondary. 

For our lower secondary curriculum, students will get to learn the skills required through specially crafted "Design-and-Make" projects.  These projects are guided by the design process which entails identifying design needs from real-world experiences.  Emphasis is being placed on the development of students’ freehand sketching skills and students are also taught the techniques to generate ideas.  Students will acquire related knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into reality which makes their learning meaningful.  

For the Secondary 3 level, the students will embark on project tasks which are pupil-driven open-ended project.  Through the projects, students are required to conduct their own research and consolidate findings to solve real-world ill-defined problems.

Our D&T curriculum aims to help our students to grow the confidence in sketching and making to create and innovate.  They will acquire the necessary skills to explore real world design opportunities and develop ideas to solve problems.

**Bridge-Building Competition for the Sec. 3 D&T students**

Students applied the concepts that they had learnt in class to design and make a model bridge that can satisfy a given set of criteria. The competition offers the students a “real-world” experience and they got to witness how their bridges fared during the testing process.
