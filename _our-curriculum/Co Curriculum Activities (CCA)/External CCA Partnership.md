<h3>External CCA Partnership (For Secondary One Students 2024)</h3>
<h4>Cluster-based CCA</h4>
<p>In order to offer a broader range of CCAs to cater for diverse student
interests, the Secondary One Students in 2025 are able to select <strong><u>one</u></strong> of
the following CCAs that are offered by the cluster schools as one of their
CCA options* in their CCA option form, subject to availability. This collaboration
encourages students from different schools to interact and collaborate,
fostering a sense of community beyond their immediate school environment.
