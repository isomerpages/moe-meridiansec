<p>The Meridian Nusantara Orchestra (MNO) is a unique Performing Arts CCA
which incorporates both Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble and Gamelan Ensemble.</p>
<p>The MNO is unique to the region and the world as it is the only orchestra
that uses traditional Indonesian gamelan instruments but tuned to the international
diatonic and chromatic music scale of western instruments. This has also
allowed the fusion of western instruments and percussions in the orchestra,
making it a truly Singaporean Orchestra with an international perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>

<p>MNO was invited to perform for Nostalgia Raya 2024 and share the joy of
the festivity with the residence at Pasir Ris Central Community Club. The
Secondary 3 MNOs serenaded them with two songs – a classic Raya melody,
‘Suasana Hari Raya’ and the current trending song ‘Alamak Raya Lagi’. Residence
loved the performance that they requested for an encore! Kudos to these
Meridians who have touched the hearts of our Pasir Ris Community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MNO came together to celebrate National Day and the country’s incredible
journey as a nation from a small island to a thriving global hub. The MNO
dedicated the iconic song ‘One People, One Nation, One Singapore’ to honor
our rich culture, diversity, and resilience that make us truly unique.
Majulah Singapura!</p>

<p><strong>2021 National Day Virtual Orchestra</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, the Heightened Alert Phase disrupted MNO’s original preparation
for a live National Day performance. However, MNO was not disheartened.
Our resourceful instructor, Mr Shaik, decided to create a virtual orchestra.
Within a few eCCA sessions, MNO learnt how to use Digital Audio Workstations,
such as Bandlab, to record rhythms, melodic lines, and students’ voices
for this song.</p>

<p>"I feel that MNO is like a family. It gives me a strong sense of belonging
and makes me feel safe. I joined because I had experience with anklung
and kulintang in primary school, but you don’t need to be musically talented
to join this CCA. I’ve learned to multitask and adapt quickly here. Although
I usually keep music notes in my head, I've found that writing them down
can also be helpful. These skills are useful for the future, as being able
to multitask will help me complete projects and tasks more efficiently.
Additionally, learning how to absorb information quickly has sharpened
my ability to learn at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Overall, MNO is an amazing place to be."</p>

<p>"Having had the opportunity to serve as a level leader for two consecutive
years, MNO has given me the chance to develop and refine my leadership
skills. MNO aims to ignite young musicians' passion, inspiring them to
pursue their musical dreams, and it has also taught me valuable life lessons.
Through this experience, I’ve become a more resilient and self-motivated
person, constantly striving to improve my character. The journey hasn’t
always been easy, but the results are incredibly rewarding and fulfilling."&nbsp;</p>
