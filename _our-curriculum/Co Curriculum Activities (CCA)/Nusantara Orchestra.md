<h3>Highlights</h3>
<h4>2025</h4>
<p>The <strong>Meridian Nusantara Orchestra (MNO)</strong> has made Meridian
proud at the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2025</strong>, achieving <strong>Double Distinction</strong> in
both the <strong>Kulintang</strong> and <strong>Gamelan</strong> categories.
This outstanding accomplishment is a testament to the students’ <strong>dedication, discipline, and teamwork</strong>.
Months of focused rehearsals and a shared passion for music enabled the
orchestra to perform with precision and heart, showcasing the beauty of
traditional Indonesian instruments in perfect harmony. Their success not
only reflects their musical excellence but also embodies the true Meridian
spirit of perseverance, collaboration, and pride. Congratulations to the
MNO for this remarkable achievement!</p>
<h4>2024</h4>
<p><strong>VIA Mentoring Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary 3 MNO girls mentor Nusantara Orchestra students from Haig Girls
to coach them in their preparation for SYF performance. The collaboration
was meaningful as it forged a sisterhood among the girls.</p>

<p>MNO was invited to perform for Nostalgia Raya 2024 and share the joy of
the festivity with the residence at Pasir Ris Central Community Club. The
Secondary 3 MNOs serenaded them with two songs – a classic Raya melody,
‘Suasana Hari Raya’ and the current trending song ‘Alamak Raya Lagi’. Residence
loved the performance that they requested for an encore! Kudos to these
Meridians who have touched the hearts of our Pasir Ris Community.</p>

<p>"I feel that MNO is like a family. It gives me a strong sense of belonging
and makes me feel safe. I joined because I had experience with anklung
and kulintang in primary school, but you don’t need to be musically talented
to join this CCA. I’ve learned to multitask and adapt quickly here. Although
I usually keep music notes in my head, I've found that writing them down
can also be helpful. These skills are useful for the future, as being able
to multitask will help me complete projects and tasks more efficiently.
Additionally, learning how to absorb information quickly has sharpened
my ability to learn at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Overall, MNO is an amazing place to be."</p>

<p>"Having had the opportunity to serve as a level leader for two consecutive
years, MNO has given me the chance to develop and refine my leadership
skills. MNO aims to ignite young musicians' passion, inspiring them to
pursue their musical dreams, and it has also taught me valuable life lessons.
Through this experience, I’ve become a more resilient and self-motivated
person, constantly striving to improve my character. The journey hasn’t
always been easy, but the results are incredibly rewarding and fulfilling."&nbsp;</p>
