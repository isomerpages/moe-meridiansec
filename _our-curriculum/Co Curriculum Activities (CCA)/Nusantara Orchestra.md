<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Meridian Nusantara Orchestra (MNO) – Where Tradition Meets Innovation!</p>
<p>Step into the world of rhythm, culture, and creativity with the Meridian
Nusantara Orchestra (MNO) a one-of-a-kind Performing Arts CCA that brings
together the rich sounds of the Angklung, Kulintang, and Gamelan Ensembles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;What makes us truly special?</p>
<p>MNO is the only orchestra that plays traditional Indonesian gamelan instruments
tuned to the international diatonic and chromatic scales, allowing a harmonious
fusion of traditional and Western instruments. The result? A uniquely Singaporean
sound with a global touch — vibrant, dynamic, and full of heart.</p>
<p>Through exciting performances and meaningful collaborations, MNO members
grow not only as musicians but as confident, disciplined, and resilient
individuals who know the power of teamwork and expression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whether you’re a seasoned musician or just curious about exploring
new sounds, MNO welcomes you to discover music like never before — and
be part of a tradition that celebrates both heritage and innovation!</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<h4><strong>2024</strong></h4>

<p>MNO was invited to perform for Nostalgia Raya 2024 and share the joy of
the festivity with the residence at Pasir Ris Central Community Club. The
Secondary 3 MNOs serenaded them with two songs – a classic Raya melody,
‘Suasana Hari Raya’ and the current trending song ‘Alamak Raya Lagi’. Residence
loved the performance that they requested for an encore! Kudos to these
Meridians who have touched the hearts of our Pasir Ris Community.</p>

<p>“Being the Chairperson of MNO has given me a good opportunity to develop
my leadership skills. I have learnt to exercise servant leadership. I have
learnt to lead this CCA by empowering my fellow exco members and inspiring
my fellow MNO members.” –&nbsp;<strong>Rafael Azfar</strong>, 4E3 (pictured

<p><strong>2021 National Day Virtual Orchestra</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, the Heightened Alert Phase disrupted MNO’s original preparation
for a live National Day performance. However, MNO was not disheartened.
Our resourceful instructor, Mr Shaik, decided to create a virtual orchestra.
Within a few eCCA sessions, MNO learnt how to use Digital Audio Workstations,
such as Bandlab, to record rhythms, melodic lines, and students’ voices
for this song.</p>

<p>"I feel that MNO is like a family. It gives me a strong sense of belonging
and makes me feel safe. I joined because I had experience with anklung
and kulintang in primary school, but you don’t need to be musically talented
to join this CCA. I’ve learned to multitask and adapt quickly here. Although
I usually keep music notes in my head, I've found that writing them down
can also be helpful. These skills are useful for the future, as being able
to multitask will help me complete projects and tasks more efficiently.
Additionally, learning how to absorb information quickly has sharpened
my ability to learn at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Overall, MNO is an amazing place to be."</p>

<p>"Having had the opportunity to serve as a level leader for two consecutive
years, MNO has given me the chance to develop and refine my leadership
skills. MNO aims to ignite young musicians' passion, inspiring them to
pursue their musical dreams, and it has also taught me valuable life lessons.
Through this experience, I’ve become a more resilient and self-motivated
person, constantly striving to improve my character. The journey hasn’t
always been easy, but the results are incredibly rewarding and fulfilling."&nbsp;</p>
