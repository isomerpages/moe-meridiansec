<p>As a netball player, I have learned important skills such as proper warm-up
exercises, ball drills to improve control, understanding the rules of the
game, and even umpiring. Through this experience, I strengthened values
like confidence, emotional intelligence, and perseverance. I faced challenges
with self-confidence and team communication, but I overcame them by improving
my performance each game and learning to understand my teammates’ strengths
and weaknesses. Overall, this journey has helped me grow into a more responsible
and disciplined person, while also sharpening my ability to strategize,
plan, and execute effectively.</p>
