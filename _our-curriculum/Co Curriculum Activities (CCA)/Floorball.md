<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Established in 2006, the Meridian Floorball Co-Curricular Activity at
our school has grown into a powerhouse of talent and determination. Each
year, our teams—B Division (Boys), B Division (Girls), C Division (Boys),
and C Division (Girls)—proudly compete in the National School Games (Floorball).</p>
<p>Renowned for their skill and sportsmanship, our teams consistently rank
among the Top in the nation, cementing our school’s reputation as a formidable
contender in the sport. Over the years, several of our players have earned

Floorball setups and inspiring the next generation of players.</p>
