<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>To develop students into effective channels of sports enthusiasts who
have a passion for floorball and applying life skills into their daily
lives</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Using floorball training as a platform to develop their physical, emotional
and social cognitive as well as physical skills. This provides students
not only with a context for the application of skills but provides opportunities
for teachers and coaches to bring out current affairs and relevant issues
into their daily lives through the trainings, providing for a more holistic
education.</p>
<p>In addition, student athletes will also be challenged beyond the physical
training to understand the importance of being a student athlete and balancing
that between their passion in sports with their studies. Meridian Floorball
Team has always been in the Top 4 for nationals all these years.</p>

<p><em>“My experience in floorball is one that I will never forget. In my 4 years playing floorball in Meridian Secondary, not only have I become a much better player, I have also become a better person. I have made countless new friends and bonded with them through our tough and grueling training sessions. The sport of floorball has brought me immense joy and has been a staple in the memories I have made in secondary school. I will never forget what the sport of floorball has done for me for the rest of my life.”</em>

<p><em>“4 years in Meridian Floorball and there is only two words to describe it, SIMPLY AWESOME! Since Sec 1 when I was selected to represent the Meridian Secondary School for National School Games, our experience and bonding as a team grew stronger. I can still remember vividly when I participated in the first ever NSG in Sec 1 where we got 4th. In our eyes we are already champions of C Division Floorball. Covid hit the world, and everything was a standstill. However, it did not stop each of us to practice hard, meet through Zoom for trainings and persevere to ensure that we improve our skills. This year, I had the privilege and trust to be named Captain and able to lead the team all the way to Finals in NSG B Division. Crowned 2nd, we are still proud of the hard work and determination we had put in as a team. Without the motivation from teachers and coaches and support from the team, I will not be where I am today in Floorball.”</em>
