### Goal

To develop students into effective channels of sports enthusiasts who have a passion for floorball and applying life skills into their daily lives

### Approach

Using floorball training as a platform to develop their physical, emotional and social cognitive as well as physical skills. This provides students not only with a context for the application of skills but provides opportunities for teachers and coaches to bring out current affairs and relevant issues into their daily lives through the trainings, providing for a more holistic education.

In addition, student athletes will also be challenged beyond the physical training to understand the importance of being a student athlete and balancing that between their passion in sports with their studies. Meridian Floorball Team has always been in the Top 4 for nationals all these years.

_“My experience in floorball is one that I will never forget. In my 4 years playing floorball in Meridian Secondary, not only have I become a much better player, I have also become a better person. I have made countless new friends and bonded with them through our tough and grueling training sessions. The sport of floorball has brought me immense joy and has been a staple in the memories I have made in secondary school. I will never forget what the sport of floorball has done for me for the rest of my life.”_

– Ismail Hassan Bin Zulkieflimansyah (4E3 2022), Captain, B Division Boys

_“4 years in Meridian Floorball and there is only two words to describe it, SIMPLY AWESOME! Since Sec 1 when I was selected to represent the Meridian Secondary School for National School Games, our experience and bonding as a team grew stronger. I can still remember vividly when I participated in the first ever NSG in Sec 1 where we got 4th. In our eyes we are already champions of C Division Floorball. Covid hit the world, and everything was a standstill. However, it did not stop each of us to practice hard, meet through Zoom for trainings and persevere to ensure that we improve our skills. This year, I had the privilege and trust to be named Captain and able to lead the team all the way to Finals in NSG B Division. Crowned 2nd, we are still proud of the hard work and determination we had put in as a team. Without the motivation from teachers and coaches and support from the team, I will not be where I am today in Floorball.”_

– Nur Dinah Adriana Binte Mohammad Azmi (4A2 2022), Captain B Division Girls
