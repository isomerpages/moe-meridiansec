<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p><strong>Nur Alya Herina Binte Wahindra,&nbsp;(4E3 2025), Captain, B Division Girls</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>My experience in Meridian Floorball has been one
of the most memorable parts of my journey in Meridian Secondary School.
I joined Meridian Floorball through the Direct School Admission Exercise
and when I first started, I had little experience. However, through hard
work, determination and the unwavering support of my teammates, I grew
not only as a player but also as a person. Over the past four years, I
have gone through a rollercoaster of emotions during trainings and NSG—stress,
pressure, joy, and even disappointment. Despite the tough losses and intense
training sessions, my team and I never gave up. Along the way, I formed
strong bonds with my teammates and made many new friends who shared the
same struggles and triumphs. Being a part of Meridian Floorball has brought
me immense joy, and I’ll carry with me the memories I have made with my
teammates, coaches and teachers forever!</p>

<p><strong>Mohamad Shaif Bin Zulkifli,&nbsp;(2-2 2025), Captain, C Division Boys</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;For the past two years, I have played floorball at Meridian Secondary
School, gaining valuable experience as both a player and a leader. As the
C Division Captain, I was entrusted with leading my team through training,
competitions and school tournaments. In this role, I worked closely with
my teammates to strengthen team spirit, improve discipline and drive consistent
progress in our gameplay. I was challenged to lead by example, communicate
effectively and motivate others to perform their best on and off the court.
Beyond our results, I am proud of the resilience and unity we built as
a team, which enabled us to face every challenge with determination. My
journey in floorball has not only deepened my passion for the sport but
has also equipped me with essential leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving
skills, that I know will benefit me in all future endeavors.</p>
