<h3>Our CCA Experience:</h3>
<p><em>I am incredibly proud to have been a part of schools Floorball CCA for the past four years. Covid struck in my first year in secondary school, feeling hopeless that I may not experience the opportunity to play in the National School Games, it did not stop us from continuing to train. For example, our teachers put up zoom training lessons at home to improve, as well as putting up challenges for us to run every week, with a 1 kilometer increase in our distance goal every week until school starts again. One of the most memorable moments during my time with the team was achieving my first medal for the school in 2022. Despite the colour of the medals we brought home, i've learnt so much and definitely enjoyed playing that season with my seniors. In my last NSG season in 2023, I was trusted to wear the captain arm band and lead the team to championship. Depite failure to reach the top 8, in our hearts, we knew that we are much stronger and as seniors, we put our trust and hope to our juniors to bring our championship back the next season. It was a testament to the dedication, hard work, and teamwork that our team embodied. I've definitely had many regrets and this experience has not only shaped my time in school but has also taught me valuable lessons in perseverance and collaboration that will undoubtedly stay with me throughout my life.</em>

<p><em>As I reflect on my journey as a team captain, the bond between players has been a source of both strength and camaraderie. We found a harmonious balance, where everyone could chill while maintaining a serious focus when it mattered most. The unwavering support of my juniors and teammates, who effortlessly embraced leadership roles, has been instrumental in my growth. I've learned that overthinking hinders performance, and embracing consistency, even on challenging days, is key. The period post NSG 2022 exposed me to diverse coaching styles and tactics, demanding quick adaptation. These experiences have profoundly shaped my understanding of floorball.</em>

<p><em>“My experience in floorball is one that I will never forget. In my 4 years playing floorball in Meridian Secondary, not only have I become a much better player, I have also become a better person. I have made countless new friends and bonded with them through our tough and grueling training sessions. The sport of floorball has brought me immense joy and has been a staple in the memories I have made in secondary school. I will never forget what the sport of floorball has done for me for the rest of my life.”</em>

<p><em>“4 years in Meridian Floorball and there is only two words to describe it, SIMPLY AWESOME! Since Sec 1 when I was selected to represent the Meridian Secondary School for National School Games, our experience and bonding as a team grew stronger. I can still remember vividly when I participated in the first ever NSG in Sec 1 where we got 4th. In our eyes we are already champions of C Division Floorball. Covid hit the world, and everything was a standstill. However, it did not stop each of us to practice hard, meet through Zoom for trainings and persevere to ensure that we improve our skills. This year, I had the privilege and trust to be named Captain and able to lead the team all the way to Finals in NSG B Division. Crowned 2nd, we are still proud of the hard work and determination we had put in as a team. Without the motivation from teachers and coaches and support from the team, I will not be where I am today in Floorball.”</em>
