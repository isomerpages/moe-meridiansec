<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong>The Meridian Media Club</strong> is a dynamic community of passionate
storytellers — photographers, videographers, and sound enthusiasts who
bring school events to life through their creative lenses.</p>
<p>From morning assemblies to major concerts, our Media Club members are
the heartbeat behind every successful event. They capture unforgettable
moments, manage live sound, and craft stunning visuals that light up our
social media and preserve our school’s proud memories for years to come.</p>
<p>But it’s not just about covering events — it’s about growth. Members sharpen
their skills through professional workshops and hands-on training in photography,
videography, and sound engineering. They also put their creativity to the
test in national competitions such as <em>Our Schools, Our Stories Photo and Video Competition</em>,
the <em>Ngee Ann Kongsi Photographic Exhibition</em>, and the <em>Appreciating NSmen Videography Competition</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Beyond the school grounds, they dive into the media world through
learning journeys to industry leaders like <em>Games Maker’s Lab</em> and <em>TrueWorld Studio</em>,
gaining real-world insights into how stories are crafted for audiences
everywhere.</p>

<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p>“I have gained many new experiences in Media Club, such as learning how
to operate the AVA system, which is truly amazing. I have also made many
new friends in Media Club—friends I might not have made in any other CCA.”</p>
<p><strong>Zelig 2-1</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The skills we’ve gained and the trust we’ve built in Media Club will
stay with us forever. Together, we’ve captured moments that can never be
relived — so treasure them while they last.”</p>
