<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The Meridian Media Club is a vibrant, close-knit community of students
with a shared passion for photography, videography, and live sound production.
Throughout the year, these dedicated members work tirelessly to support
the school’s media needs, capturing memorable moments and ensuring that
every event runs seamlessly.</p>
<p>Playing essential roles in morning assemblies, major events, and concerts,
these students not only contribute to the success of each occasion but
also skillfully document these experiences for social media and future
publications. Their efforts help build a visual legacy for the school while
connecting the community through shared memories.</p>
<h3>Our Objectives</h3>
<p>To refine their craft, club members participate in professional training
sessions, gaining hands-on experience in photography and videography. They
also challenge themselves in competitions like the Our Schools, Our Stories
Photo and Video Contest and the Ngee Ann Kongsi Photographic Exhibition,
where they push their creative boundaries. To further deepen their understanding
of the media industry, they embark on learning journeys to professional
media organizations such as The Smart Local and TrueWorld Studio, gaining
insights into real-world media production.</p>
