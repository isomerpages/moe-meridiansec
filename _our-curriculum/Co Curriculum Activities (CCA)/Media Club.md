The Meridian Media Club is a tightly-knit group of enthusiastic students who share a passion for photography, videography, and live sound production. Throughout the year, they dedicate themselves tirelessly to support various visual and media needs within our school community.

These dedicated students serve the school in a multitude of ways, ensuring the smooth execution of morning assemblies, playing pivotal roles in the success of major events and concerts. They not only contribute to these events' success but also capture invaluable moments to share on social media platforms and preserve for future publications.

To enhance their skills, the club organizes professional training sessions in photography and videography, enabling members to expand their expertise. Additionally, they eagerly participate in competitions like the 'Our Schools, Our Stories' Photo and Video contest and the Ngee Ann Kongsi Photographic exhibition to push their creative boundaries further."
