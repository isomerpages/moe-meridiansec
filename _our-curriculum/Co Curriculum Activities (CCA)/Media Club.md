The Meridian Media Club is a tightly-knit group of enthusiastic students who share a passion for photography, videography, and live sound production. Throughout the year, they dedicate themselves tirelessly to support various visual and media needs within our school community.

These dedicated students serve the school in a multitude of ways, ensuring the smooth execution of morning assemblies, playing pivotal roles in the success of major events and concerts. They not only contribute to these events' success but also capture invaluable moments to share on social media platforms and preserve for future publications.

To enhance their skills, the club organizes professional training sessions in photography and videography, enabling members to expand their expertise. Additionally, they eagerly participate in competitions like the 'Our Schools, Our Stories' Photo and Video contest and the Ngee Ann Kongsi Photographic exhibition to push their creative boundaries further."

### Our CCA Experience

*Media club is truly amazing and teaches me the ropes of Photography. It is a place of bonding, learning and of nurturing of the minds. The skills I’ve acquired cannot be acquired simply by reading.*
<br>**- Malcolm Pong Jia Le (3E1)**

*It is a vibrant hub of creativity and collaboration, where ideas come to life and voices found resonance.* 
<br>**- Javier Mok Sing Lam (3E1)**

*Media Club is definitely the CCA to be in if you're interested in anything Media related. With both amazing teachers and opportunities, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in this CCA.*
<br>**- Dionne Pang Lin Kai (3E2)**
