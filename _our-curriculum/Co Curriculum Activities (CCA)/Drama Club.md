<p>The Meridian Drama Club encourages students who have an interest in drama
to practise and showcase their talents to the school. Our thespians are
not only trained to explore the world of performance but are also provided
with an all-rounded learning experience and appreciation for theatre. Besides
acting, our members perform a diverse range of tasks; from working on set
for performances to the creation of costumes, as well as lighting and sound
design. This ultimately allows one to develop essential life skills such
as confidence, improvisation, effective language and communication, as
well as emotional intelligence through warm-up exercises, bonding games
and various other activities.</p>

<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p><em>Personally, my experience as a senior has shown how much I have grown in these past 3 years. Initially, I had horrible stage fright. However, that has long changed since I joined this club. I am now more confident. I have reveled at my seniors on how approachable and communicative they are. As a club, we are very comfortable with our peers and we do not hesitate to help one another. &nbsp;I can boldly say that we, the new batch of seniors will continue this “tradition”.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>-Ya Pei, 3E4 (2024)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>I truly believe that Drama Club has changed who I am as a person. I’ve never been the one for change so taking the leap from primary school theatre to abstracts for SYF was truly an experience. I adore the family-like bond that the club has. That kampong spirit that is getting lost in today’s world. Though, it can be challenging at times to have adapt to different performance styles, I am forever grateful to the club for giving me these experiences that I could never replicate on my own. -</em><strong><em>Aliyah 4E1 (2024)&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>I’ve been in Drama club for slightly over a year now and have only good things to say about this CCA. Drama club is like therapy to me. I enjoy the bonding activities and preparing for performances with all my comrades. Sometimes it can be stressful, but it’s a good stress. It leaves me rather satisfied after a performance. For example, SYF, Go Green @ MSS, Thespian Lab.&nbsp;</em><strong><em>-Yihan 2/6 (2024)</em></strong>

<p><em>Personally, my experience as a junior in Meridian Drama Club has been interesting and enjoyable. I revel at my seniors on how approachable and communicative they are. As a club we are very comfortable with each other and are always helping one another. It really warms my heart to see such camaraderie in my CCA. Our Drama coach, Mr Danny has made all of us feel very welcome. He patiently answers all our queries and will come up with the best possible solutions to help any situations we are facing. He is very confident as a coach and we have certainly learnt a repertoire of skills from him. I remember when I first started I had horrible stage fright. But now, it’s much better now due to the encouragement of my Drama mates. If you’re someone who wants to overcome your fears, take the challenge and join us. I promise you, you will not regret it. In the words of our instructor, Mr Danny, “Confidence is a choice.” So make that choice.</em><strong>– Lim Ya Pei, 1E1</strong>
</p>
<p><em>The Meridian Drama Club changed my life. Before joining this club, I was a very shy and meek boy, lacking in confidence. But now I am capable of confidently talking to others that I may not be very close with, even strangers, when I could not before. I have participated in many of the Club's performances, from the SYF 2021 to the NDP 2022 skit. I have matured quite a lot in that timeframe, in becoming a better actor and person. Although the rehearsals were vigorous, especially for SYF, it was worth it for the journey along the way, working for the performance, and taking my part in making the Drama Club a distinction award club. Not only that, I have also met many good friends inside the Drama Club, people who I am extremely fond of. I consider it my safe and happy space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><strong><em>- Iman, Alumni</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Drama club has helped to grow my confidence in public speaking and has taught me the importance of collaborating with my contemporaries. Because of this, I am confident about voicing out my opinions in class discussions. I have taken on emcee responsibilities as I am more confident in speaking in front of a large audience.&nbsp;</em><strong><em>-Qistina, Alumni</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Drama provided me with a safe space twice a week to express my emotions freely through acting. Being in the club did not only equip me with acting chops, but also transferable skills that have helped me tremendously in my life such as confidence and discipline. Most importantly, the camaraderie and the friends I had made in Drama are certainly bonds that I treasure and am forever grateful for.&nbsp;</em><strong><em>-Edward, Alumni</em></strong>
