<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I have really enjoyed my CCA for the past 3 years. It helps me to be a
better person by being more brave in doing stuff. I even overcame my fear
of heights by repelling down the building during my camp steel in 2024.
I am really passionate about this CCA and I am proud to receive the role
that was given to me. During my journey in this CCA, I was taught to not
give up during tough times and to be more discipline. I am also able to
bond together with my batch mate and together we gained a lot of skills
and we get to know each other better. It was hard at first when I started
to join the CCA in 2023 as we have less knowledge about NCC. However, through
thick and thin, we helped each other to sharpen our drill.</p>

Major (3-3, 2025)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My experience of the past three years as a member of the National Cadet
Corps. These years have been nothing short of transformative for me. The
NCC has not only shaped my character but has instilled in me values that
I will carry with me for the rest of my life. When I first joined the NCC,
I came with an open mind and a desire to grow. Little did I know that these
three years would teach me some of the most valuable life lessons I could
ever learn. Among the many lessons I absorbed, the three that stand out
the most are resilience, respect, and integrity.</p>
<p>Resilience, for me, is the ability to withstand adversity, push through
challenges, and emerge stronger. Throughout my time in the NCC, I encountered
many obstacles — from physically demanding drills to challenging field
exercises, and at times, personal struggles. But in those moments of exhaustion,
when my body screamed for rest, I learned to push myself beyond my limits.
The spirit of camaraderie within the NCC played a significant role in this
process. We were all in it together, facing the same challenges, supporting
each other, and motivating one another to keep going. I learned that resilience
is not about avoiding difficulties but about confronting them head-on,
learning from them, and coming out on the other side with a stronger mind
and body. NCC taught me the importance of respect — not just for my officers,
seniors, or peers, but also for myself and the world around me. Respect,
I learned, is not a one-way street. It’s about recognizing the dignity
of others, valuing their opinions, and honoring their contributions. During
my time here, I learned that respect is shown not only through words but
through actions. Whether it was helping a fellow cadet with a difficult
drill or listening carefully to the instructions of our seniors, I came
to understand that respect is an essential pillar of teamwork and discipline.
It’s about creating an environment where everyone feels valued and heard,
and where trust is built through mutual understanding. Integrity is the
foundation upon which everything else stands. It’s easy to do the right
thing when no one is watching, but the true test of integrity comes when
faced with difficult decisions.&nbsp; NCC has continually pushed me to
uphold the highest standards of honesty and ethical behavior, regardless
of the situation. Whether it was in training, while handling responsibilities,
or even during moments of personal conflict, I learned that integrity means
staying true to your values, even when it’s inconvenient or uncomfortable.
It’s about being honest with yourself and others, making decisions that
align with your moral compass, and never compromising on what is right.
As I reflect on these past three years, I realize how much I have grown
as a person. The lessons of resilience, respect, and integrity are not
just qualities that I’ve learned within the walls of the NCC; they are
values that will continue to guide me throughout my life. The NCC has equipped
me with the strength to face challenges, the understanding to respect others,
and the courage to always act with integrity.</p>
