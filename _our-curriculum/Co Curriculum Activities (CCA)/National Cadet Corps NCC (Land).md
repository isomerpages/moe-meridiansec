<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p><em>My experience throughout the 3 years in the National Cadet Corps (NCC) has been transformative, shaping my character and instilling essential life skills and values. One of the key takeaways has been resilience and perseverance. NCC taught me the value of not giving up, pushing through solutions even in tough situations and communicating efficiently with my platoon mates. Through demanding foot and rifle drills training and even my own expectations, I learned discipline, focus and attention to detail — qualities that extend far beyond my CCA session. In addition to my mental fortitude, I also learned how to tie different knots and construct a tent which honed my problem-solving abilities and teamwork with my platoon mates. It taught me the importance of clear communication and cooperation with one another to achieve a common goal. Additionally, the shared experience during the various NCC activities strengthen the bonds of friendship among peers. As a CCA leader in NCC, I have built confidence overtime and taken initiative in guiding my peers to forge a stronger bond amongst this family. With NCC, I can speak up with confidence to peers and guide my juniors through different activities. Overall, my NCC journey has not only equipped me with practical skills but also nurtured values that I can carry into all aspects of my life. It has always been a joyful journey and will always be an unforgettable one.</em>
<br><strong>–Javan Neo Aik Yong, Unit Sergeant Major (3E3, 2023)</strong>

<p><em>These years in NCC to me have been one of the best times in my life, it will always be a journey that I will never forget. The friends and skills that I have gained in NCC will never be forgotten. The friends that I had made will have a lasting impact on myself. During the days when I was still a cadet and going through the hard yet fun days of my CCA, my friends and I will push each other to do our best. Some of my batch mates have also become some of the closest friends I will ever have. From this, I have realised that NCC is not just a CCA but also a place where I will build long lasting friendships. I have even managed to maintain and foster friendships with my juniors and seniors in the CCA. My seniors as taught me almost all the things that I have learnt in NCC, like my values and other life skills. As for my juniors in NCC, although I make sure they know that NCC is not a time to play and to be serious, after CCA I would go the extra mile to play a game of football with them to foster and build on our friendship. I will make sure that I can be someone that they will not fear but instead be someone that must be respected but also someone that they can have fun with and can confide in. NCC has also taught me values that has shaped me into what I am today. The core values of NCC, Loyalty to Country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility, care for fellow cadets, adventurous spirit, and safety, serves as my moral compass in life. Being a CCA leader in this CCA makes me want to do better every day. NCC has taught me to overcome any challenges that I might face, showing resilience and I will do my best to excel in everything that I do. This was really put to test during our weekly foot drills, I would always put in the effort to do my best. Even though sometimes the foot drills get hard and tiring I will still push on and not falter. Another way my resilience was tested was through the hard physical training. We would do many hard and gruelling activities that will really work our muscles as well as put our mental strength to the test, during these times I will push on and try my hardest. Another value that has helped me is discipline. Through the weekly foot drills, I have learnt discipline like eye discipline and not moving in a file. This has helped me in my everyday life as I would always think about my actions before I act and not do anything reckless. Being a CCA leader, I can safely say that I have learnt to be more assertive and braver to voice out my opinion. I remember back when I was in Secondary 1, I was a very timid boy who feared saying what’s on his mind and would be what is known as a ‘pushover’ but over the years in NCC, it has built my confidence in leading and serving others. I will definitely assure you that you will not regret choosing NCC as your CCA as I know that you will have a enjoyable and memorable yet a fulfilling and enriching time in this CCA.</em>
