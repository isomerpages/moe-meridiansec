### Mission
Our mission at the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps is to develop and empower our students to be active and concerned citizens who advocate life-saving skills. Our training program aims to impart civil defence knowledge and skills to students as well as develop and mould their character and leadership qualities. In addition, we aim to imbue in students an awareness of homeland security through National Education and community service.
