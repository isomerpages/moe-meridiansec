<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>At Meridian Basketball, the court is our classroom. Our vision is to forge
young men of character who excel both on and off the court, understanding
that true victory lies in the values we uphold. While we relentlessly pursue
excellence in skill and fitness, our core philosophy is anchored in developing
discipline, respect, resilience, and an unwavering team spirit. We are
committed to building a brotherhood where character is the cornerstone
of every player, believing that how we play the game defines us more than
the final score.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Joining our team is a commitment to this ethos. Through rigorous
training and intense competition in the National School Games, our players
learn to embody these values under pressure. We expect every member to
adopt a selfless "we over me" mentality, contributing to a culture of mutual
support and collective success. Ultimately, a Meridian basketballer graduates
not just as a skilled athlete, but as a confident and principled young
man, equipped with the grit and integrity to lead in all aspects of his
life.</p>

<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p><strong>Zarius Tan Zhe Rui,&nbsp;(4E3, 2025), Captain of B Division Boys</strong>
</p>
<p>I am Zarius Tan from the graduating batch of 2025. My time in the Basketball
CCA has been a privilege, giving me the opportunity to lead, compete, and
grow in countless ways. Over these four years, my growth has extended far
beyond the basketball court. The CCA didn't just sharpen my skills; it
shaped my character and leadership abilities.</p>
<p>I came into this CCA with no basketball background, having never played
the sport before. Despite this, I worked hard, improved, and eventually
earned my place on the school team. My first pillar of support was my coaches.
Each had a unique perspective on the game, and they generously passed on
their teachings to me. Beyond their coaching, I was blessed with the best
teammates I could ask for. Our batch was small—just seven of us—but our
collective passion for the game was immense. While some might see it as
'just a CCA', for us, it was so much more. It was our life outside of academics
and something we genuinely cared about. This CCA became one of the most
important parts of our lives.</p>
<p>So, if you are a curious soul who is intrigued by this amazing sport,
I highly recommend joining the CCA. It builds character and discipline,
and it is where I had the most fun in my four years of secondary school.</p>

<p><strong>Hayden Mackenzie Widjaja (4T1 2025), Vice-Captain of B Division Boys</strong>
</p>
<p>These past four years in Meridian have been full of lessons that shaped
who I am today. I’ve grown not just as a student, but also as a teammate,
a leader, and a person. There were tough moments—times when I struggled
with studies, basketball, and just figuring things out—but I’m thankful
I never had to go through them alone.</p>
<p>Being part of the basketball team was a big part of my journey. It taught
me discipline, teamwork, and how to persevere when things get hard. I learned
what it means to lead by example, to be there for my teammates, and to
stay focused even when the pressure was high. Winning felt great, but losing
taught me even more. Every game and every training session left an impact
on me.</p>
<p>In school, I learned that growth doesn’t come all at once. It takes time,
effort, and people who believe in you. I’m truly grateful to my teachers,
coaches, and friends who supported me along the way, even when I didn’t
have it all together. Their encouragement helped me keep going.</p>
<p>One thing I’ll always remember about Meridian is the people. The laughs,
the support, and the small moments are what made school life so meaningful.
As I move forward, I’ll carry all these memories and lessons with me.</p>
