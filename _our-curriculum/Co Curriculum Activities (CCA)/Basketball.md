<p>An interview from our Captain and Vice-Captain:</p>
<p>“Hi, my name is Bhavesh, from class 4A3. I am the captain of Meridian
Basketball School Team. I would like to thank the teachers-in-charge, Mr
Joe, Mr Xia and Mrs Koh for their support in these past 4 years. They have
motivated us and we strive to be better after every training session. I
would like to also thank our coach, for keeping us physically and mentally
fit. He has taught us the fundamentals of basketball and trained us for
many years. Even though the result of this year’s NSG was not as fruitful
as we had anticipated, we will learn from our mistakes and do better the
following years. The sec 3 basketball players are capable and will lead
the team to new heights.”</p>
<p>“Hi, my name is Nathan, from class 4A3, Vice-Captain of Meridian Basketball
School Team. On behalf of my basketball peers, I would like to thank our
teachers-in-charge, Mr Joe, Mrs Koh and Mr Xia, for inspiring us to do
our very best in our trainings. I would like to also thank our coach, for
instilling self-discipline in us and enabling us to be better despite our
shortcomings. These past 4 years have been quite a journey for me as I
had to deal with challenges such as learning how to work as a team during
trainings. But by understanding my peers, I have come to understand what
it means to have team spirit and its importance. Juggling study time and
trainings has been challenging but time management has kept me from falling
off both ends. I hope we can learn from our defeat in this year’s National
School Games and use the experience to come back stronger. I also wish
for the sec 3s to find out their strengths and weaknesses and how they
can improve. Not everyone is perfect, but we have to try. I have faith
in the sec 3 boys that they can be good role models to their juniors. As
I step down from this Vice-Captain position, I have the peace of mind,
knowing that I leave behind such capable juniors.”</p>
