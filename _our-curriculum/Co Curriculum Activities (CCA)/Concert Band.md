Under the baton of our main band conductors, Mr Pan Chee Mun and Mr Gabriel Song, the Meridian Concert Band aims to provide positive and enriching student development experiences (SDEs) for our members.

We believe that students learn best from experiences and exposure, and that is why the band programme includes an array of activities – such as tutoring sessions from instrumental specialists, master classes with guest conductors, team-building activities, public performances, exchange programmes with other schools and opportunities to attend various external concerts and workshops.

Besides equipping band members with musicianship skills through the wide range of exclusive programmes and activities, the band also believes in developing confident and competent performers and leaders, offering platforms in leadership programmes such as the Combined Music CCA Leadership Camp and Band Student Conductor Camp.

Guided by our motto, **‘Play it Loud, Play it Proud’**, the band strives to empower all members to attain their fullest potential as musicians. To better support our Secondary 1 students, we have the senior mentors to guide them.

### Our CCA Experience
![](/images/CCA/Concert%20Band/concert_band_2023_07.jpg)

*Over these 3 years, I have been given the incredible opportunity to play in a symphonic band. It has provided me many transformative experiences. Being part of a group of musicians taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and dedication. As the Band Major, it is an experience filled with many challenges. Coordinating practices, performances, and ensuring everyone is in sync requires strong organizational skills. Although there are difficulties, the sense of accomplishment when we play as a band is truly fulfilling. This role has taught me leadership, communication, and a deep appreciation for the power of music in bringing people together*<br>
**– Band Major, Muhammad Saif Mishary Bin Muhammad Shahidin (3E1, 2023)**

*In my three and a half years as a Meridian Symphonic Band member, I can say I have made many unforgettable memories along the way, such as our performances at SYF, National Day, Staff Appreciation Day and many more. Through these events, I have developed qualities such as perseverance and teamwork to enable us to work and play in sync. I'm also very honoured to have been selected for the role of Drum Major this year.  Thank you, everyone, for your support, and I hope the band will continue to flourish in the years to come.*<br>
**– Drum Major, Muhammad Nor Ubaydillah Bin Khairullah (3E1, 2023)**

*Band is one of the things that I look forward to every week. It has provided me with a wonderful experience especially because of the friends I made along the way. Not only that, I have had various opportunities such as the Singapore International Band Festival, Singapore Youth Festival and instrumental masterclasses!*<br>
