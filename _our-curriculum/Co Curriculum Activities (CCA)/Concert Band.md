the baton of our main band conductors, Mr Pan Chee Mun and Mr Gabriel Song,
the Meridian Concert Band aims to provide positive and enriching student
development experiences (SDEs) for our members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Our Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that students learn best from experiences and exposure, and
that is why the band programme includes an array of activities – such as
tutoring sessions from instrumental specialists, master classes with guest
conductors, team-building activities, public performances, exchange programmes
with other schools and opportunities to attend various external concerts
and workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides equipping band members with musicianship skills through the wide
range of exclusive programmes and activities, the band also believes in
developing confident and competent performers and leaders, offering platforms
in leadership programmes such as the Combined Music CCA Leadership Camp
and Band Student Conductor Camp.</p>
<p>Guided by our motto,&nbsp;<strong>‘Play it Loud, Play it Proud’</strong>,
the band strives to empower all members to attain their fullest potential
as musicians. To better support our Secondary 1 students, we have the senior
mentors to guide them.</p>

<h3><strong>Our CCA Experience</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Band has been a huge part of my journey in growth and leadership. Band
offered me discipline and growth through my countless music practises.
There were times when I felt challenged, but it just all adds to the flavours
of going to band. In band we were given generous amounts of opportunities
to indulge in music performances and musical workshops, like listening
to various ochestra performances live or participating in the youth arts
leaders conference that had definitely built my character as a whole. I
feel a sense of growth and meaning in my experience in Band!</p>

<p>Band has been one of those things I’ve especially look forward to after
a long day of classes at school. It has given me mediums to express myself
through music, and wonderful various opportunities such as the Singapore
Youth Festival, Singapore International Band Festival, Festival Winds and
has even inspired me to play in external community bands!</p>
