The Robotics Club was set up in March 2001 specifically as another avenue whereby our pupils could channel their creative and innovative energies. Currently, the club has evolved the knowledge to a few programs such as LEGO-EV3, LEGO- Spike, Micro Bit/Strawbees program and the recent Intel AI for Youth program. The club has also involved with glider making which was based on student interest to participate in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition in the last 6 years.

The Robotics members are creative, inquisitive and passionate young people who have desire to learn the latest development of robotics technology which will benefit the environment and mankind. With strong foundation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) coupled with good research and presentation skills, the Robotics Club members believed in being a holistic life-long students of the 21st century and gearing towards Smart nation.

### Our CCA Experience

_In my three years of being in Robotics Club, I am glad to have great seniors who were patient in guiding me through the steps of coding even when I was still new, I am also truly fortunate to have friendly members in the CCA whom I can communicate with to build better experiences for the juniors in the CCA. Overall, Robotics was a great experience for me, throughout the time in Meridian.

**– Chan Hao Yang, 3E3, 2022 (Chairman of Robotics Club 2022)**

_When I joined robotics, I was unsure of the environment there and if I would have a good relationship with my fellow members. However, I met with many different people whom I soon became friends with. I have learnt many skills from robotics such as teamwork and communication with other team members._&nbsp;_I have also participated in many competitions where we have faced many difficult competitors from different schools. Even though we did not win this year, I feel that this loss has only given us more confidence to try harder to win next year. I definitely do not regret joining the Meridian Robotics, CCA, and I hope that I will have another fun and engaging experience next year!

**– Seah Yang En, 3E3, 2022 (Vice Chairman of Robotics Club 2022)**

_My experience in Robotics has been great, I have been able to experience a lot of new things for the first time. From interacting with my CCA mates to build and program robots, to even entering competitions with them, Robotics Club has provided me with many opportunities. I am forever grateful for the memories I have made in this CCA and I sincerely recommend everyone to give this CCA a shot._
