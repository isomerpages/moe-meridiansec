Founded on 30 September 1949, the Singapore Red Cross is an independent humanitarian organisation that is non-political, non-religious and is part of the International Federation of the Red Cross. SRC adheres to the Geneva Convention (1949) and bases its work on the fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality, independence, neutrality, unity, universality and voluntary service.

Red Cross Youth is a co-curricular activity that integrates character-building, leadership, essential lifesaving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.

Throughout the year, we participate in a variety of programmes and events hosted by Red Cross Youth. The events are as follows:-

### Quote

_“In Sec 2, I joined NDP 2019 at the Padang. It was the best decision I have ever made, because not only was I able to represent Meridian Red Cross during National Day, I’ve made a lot of new friends from Red Cross, NCC, NCDCC, Girls Brigade, etc. Although I had to sacrifice half a year’s worth of Saturdays, I believe it was time well-spent for the new experiences and people I have met.”_
