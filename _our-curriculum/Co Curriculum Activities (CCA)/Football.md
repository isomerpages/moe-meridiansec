<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Founded in 2017, Meridian Football has rapidly grown into a powerhouse
under the expert leadership of Coach Fabio. In a respectful and supportive
environment, our footballers are nurtured to reach their full potential,
both on and off the field.</p>

reached the finals of the National School Games (NSG). Our B Division boys,
B Division girls, and C Division girls clinched the coveted Championship
titles, solidifying our reputation as a formidable force in Secondary School
Football. Over the years, our B and C Division teams have consistently
ranked among the top 4 in their respective divisions, showcasing their
dedication, discipline, and passion for the game.</p>

for excellence and fostering a love for football in every player.</p>

<p>&gt; MSS football has many potential players and a great coach. It was
a good experience to play for the school as it has taught me teamwork and
responsibility. I am proud to be developed as a striker and to have scored
many goals for the school. &gt; &gt; Muhammad Syazwan</p>
