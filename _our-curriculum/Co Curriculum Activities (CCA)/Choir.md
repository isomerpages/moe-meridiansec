<p>The Meridian Secondary School (MSS) Choir was formed in 1999 by the late
Madam Ong Foon. The Choir aims to bring out the best in all members through
rigorous training in vocal techniques and musicality. Opportunities are
also given to develop students’ leadership skills. MSS Choir provides students
with avenues to develop their interpersonal skills when working together,
and areas to build their personal confidence and self-esteem when they
perform regularly on stage. The Choir has grown to a proud strength of
60 singers. Since 2019, we have recruited male voices and are now a full
SATB Choir (Sopranos, Altos, Tenors and Basses)!</p>
<p>The Choir actively performs in school events. Other performances include
the National Day Parade as part of the Combined Secondary School Choir,
charitable concerts at Changi General Hospital, and Pasir Ris West CC events.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Choir joined hands with the other performing
arts groups (MNO, Band and Dance) to celebrate our nation’s 59th birthday
by putting up a vibrant and exciting performance on Arts Day. Their rendition
of “The road ahead” and “When you believe” helped put the spotlight on
the 2024 NDP theme of “Together, As One United People”.</p>

<h4>2023</h4>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2023</strong> 
<br>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation was the biggest highlight
of the year for the Choir, especially because many of us were participating
in such an event for the very first time. It was certainly an occasion
to remember as the Choir worked hard to reach vocal perfection after many
months of relentless practice. The transformation of the Choir was complete,
from the first moments members received the scores for the various pieces
to the moment they stepped on to the stage for their performance. The Choir
presented three songs, namely: * Morning Rain * O Magnum Mysterium * The
Goslings</p>

<h4>2022</h4>
<p><strong>Sec 4 Values in Action – Showing Appreciation to Support Staff</strong> 
<br>To show appreciation to our school’s non-teaching support staff for their
hard work and dedicated service, as well as to bring joy, positivity and
sense of community to them, our Sec 4 Choir members embarked on a VIA project
to produce a video recording of the song “Evening Rise”. Kudos to our Sec
4s for their months of unyielding practice, rehearsals, and a wonderful
studio recording!</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Choir/choir-05-1.jpg">
</div>
<p>With detailed planning and preparations, Choir successfully executed a
smooth Sec 1 CCA Experience-cum-Trial programme over a few weeks. Through
lively and interesting presentations, interactions and trials, our members
were able to fully engage the Sec 1s and pique their interest to joining
Choir.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Term 3 started with a formal farewell for the Sec 4s. The Sec 1-3s were
eager to show their appreciation to their seniors and organised a most
wonderous event. The seniors were pampered with food and snacks, and taken
down the memory lane with games and quizzes. A big shout-out to Sec 4s
for your leadership, your dedication and most importantly for your tender
love and care of the juniors. You will be sorely missed!</p>

<p><strong>Concerts &amp; Workshop</strong> 
<br>Choir aims to provide our members with a platform to develop their passion
for singing through learning different genres of music and sing well with
confidence while performing. What better to way is there to learn than
by attending concerts and participating in related workshops? Members made
use of the June and September school holidays to attend a concert, Nelson’s
Voyage, held at the Victoria Concert Hall as well as participated in two
workshops held under the auspice of the Voices of Singapore Festival 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Audio &amp; Video Recording ~ Can You Feel The Love Tonight</strong> 
<br>To increase members’ musical sensitivity and hone their vocal skills in
attaining accuracy in pitch, tune and melody, all members were exposed
to music video production process – small group audio recording and on-site
video recording. So sit back and enjoy MSS Choir’s performance of The Lion
King Theme song – Can you feel the love tonight!

<p><strong>National Day performance</strong> 
<br>The highlight of this Term 3 was most definitely the National Day Celebrations
where Choir finally had the chance to perform “live”. Choir was the first
item of the day. With our rendition of “The Road Ahead”, Choir managed
to engage the students and draw them into celebrating the nation’s birthday.</p>

<p><strong>Jubilate – Joint Concert with Band</strong> 
<br>There is no better way to wrap up the year than a joint concert with Band.
Jubilate – there were certainly good reasons to rejoice and celebrate our
performance with a “live” audience in many years. It was certainly a feather
in the cap, with parents here to witness the fruits of all the hours of
hard work and practices. Well done, Choir!</p>

<p>Being the head of the Choir has been a fulfilling and rewarding experience.
It has not only improved my musical abilities but also given me the confidence
to lead. In my leadership role, I’ve developed skills such as motivating
my peers, managing time effectively, and handling challenges under pressure.
I’ve also had the chance to collaborate with others during performances,
which taught me the importance of teamwork and communication.</p>

about singing but about teamwork and perseverance. I've also learnt to
get along with my batchmates and peers. Even though everyone is different,
we've learnt to work with one another and grow together. The Choir is honestly
fun and our conductor is literally the best!</p>

<br><em>Because of Choir, I have become more confident on stage. I have made numerous friends in Choir, with many supportive peers and juniors. I have learnt and mastered a wide array of songs from pop culture like “Millions Dreams” to classical works like “O Magnum”, improving my singing techniques. Now as a student conductor, I am also learning more about leading and conducting. I have also acquired different skills like stage makeup and hand independence while conducting.</em>
