<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The journey of Meridian Modern Dance CCA also known as Meridian Madroovers
is an inspiring story to Meridians who aspire to keep their passion and
faith in dance alive. With little to no professional background in dance,
most of our dancers strive in harmony under the guidance of our dedicated
instructor, Mr Wein who believes in their individual strength to create
a troupe of motivated dancers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Starting with humble beginnings, coupled with unwavering dedication
to their craft and building personal values to grow as a team, our dancers
has developed a legacy of artistry, community engagement, and personal
growth. With perseverance and the desire to achieve higher at each stage,
our dancers continue to build a caring and uplifting culture that thrives
from dedication, passion and resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“<em>Great dancers are not great because of their technique; they are great because of their passion.”</em> —
Martha Graham, modern dancer and choreographer</p>

<h3>Yearly Highlights</h3>
<h3>2025</h3>
<p><strong>SYF 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Modern Dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) has once again brought
pride to our school by clinching the <em>Distinction Award</em> at this year’s
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).</p>
<p>Months of dedication, discipline, and passion went into preparing for
this prestigious event. From perfecting challenging choreography to refining
their expression and teamwork, the dancers worked tirelessly under the
guidance of their instructors. Rehearsals often stretched late into the
evening, with every member demonstrating resilience and commitment to excellence.</p>
<p>Their performance at the SYF was a powerful showcase of artistry, energy,
and unity. The routine captivated both the judges and audience, reflecting
not only the dancers’ technical skills but also their ability to convey
emotion and tell a story through movement.</p>
<p>Beyond the award, the journey was an invaluable learning experience. The
dancers forged stronger bonds, discovered the importance of perseverance,
and learned to embrace feedback as part of growth.</p>
<p>We are extremely proud of the Modern Dance CCA for their outstanding achievement
and for representing the school with such passion and grace.</p>

<h3>Our CCA Experience</h3>
<p><em>Being in a dance CCA taught me the importance of communication. By participating in prestigious competitions such as WSB and S24, I learnt that voicing out my thoughts about the performance help us understand each other better, foster good friendship and strong ties.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>– Sylvia Kang (3E1,2024)</strong>
</p>
<p><em>As the Chairperson of Madroovers, I am blessed to learn and grow under the guidance of my Coach, Mr Wein and the teachers. I am grateful to be given the opportunities to lead and serve the CCA. Throughout my three years in modern dance, I learn the importance of building a good relationship with my fellow juniors and seniors.</em>
