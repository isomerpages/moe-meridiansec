Through Meridian Modern Dance, dancers are exposed and experienced various genres of dance, from Hip Hop, to Urban, Street Jazz. The dancers learn good posture and awareness of body in space, developing coordination of arms feet and head, exercises that focus on core and posture. 

Our dance goes beyond just learning the steps and movements, as we also focus on imparting the right values through dance. We adopt inclusive approach as we believe in creating opportunities for everyone to thrive and make an impact for our CCA
