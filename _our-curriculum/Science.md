<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The experiential nature of science through authentic learning tasks, performance
tasks, experiments and projects cannot be dissected from the learning process
of the subject area. Science lessons in Meridian Secondary School are conducted
to elicit students’ sense of inquiry and discovery as well as to inculcate
learning using all their senses. As part of the nation-wide Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our science tasks and activities are
designed with the use of students’ personal learning devices to support
their out-of-classroom Science teaching and learning experiences.</p>
<h3>Transforming Teaching &amp; Learning to ICT-based Lesson Packages</h3>
<p>The Science department continues to develop lesson resources for bite-sized
learning for both the lower and upper secondary Science levels. ICT and
bite-sized checkpoints for Assessments for Learning (AfL) are conscientiously
included with the aim of positive student outcomes.
<br>
<br>With the push for 21st Century Competencies (21CC), it is necessary to
prepare students to be able to develop:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>effective communication</strong>, sharing ideas and expressing
opinions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>collaborative skills</strong>through group work learning and project-based
learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expose students to a variety of learning experiences especially the use
of ICT tools since they are<strong> digital learners.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a new area of focus this year would be the application of ICT-enabled
lessons in our daily lessons, using the Design Thinking approach as well
as the structure of&nbsp;<strong>I Do, We Do, You Do</strong>&nbsp;in the
lesson to improve students’ confidence and attain achievement
<br>
<br>Our programmes aim to give students the experience of conducting investigative
science projects and provide them with a platform for scientific exchange.
Students will be given opportunities to be engaged in Science workshops,
learning journeys and competitions at various Science institutions.
<br>
<br>The department continues to provide opportunities for students from all
classes and streams to participate in external Science competitions.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<h4>2025</h4>
<p><strong>1. Sec 1 miniSTEM Activity: Build a Boat, Defy Gravity!</strong>
</p>
<p>In Term 1, our Sec 1 students took on the <em>Build a Boat, Defy Gravity</em> challenge
in an exciting miniSTEM activity! Armed with cardboard and recycled materials,
students designed and built their own boats with a fun twist—keeping them
afloat while supporting a 100-gram mass for 20 seconds! Students explored
the science of buoyancy and displacement, diving into the concept that
the key to floating is displacing enough water to support the weight of
the boat and its load.</p>
<p>Through hands-on design and teamwork, students learned how small changes
in boat shape or material can impact buoyancy. After testing their boats
in water, students observed firsthand how engineering principles affect
performance. The challenge encouraged teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving,
with students building their boats while experimenting with ways to keep
them afloat.</p>

<p><strong>2. Sec 2 miniSTEM Activity: Breakthroughs in Pill Coating</strong>
</p>
<p>In Term 1, our Science teachers transform a typical science lesson into
an exciting adventure where students become innovators in pharmaceutical
technology. Imagine crafting a pill coating that shields beneficial probiotics
from the harsh, acidic environment of the stomach, ensuring they reach
the intestines intact to aid digestion.</p>
<p>Using everyday materials like flour, sodium carbonate, and water, students
mix and mold their own protective layers around simulated probiotics. The
thrill comes in testing these creations in hydrochloric acid, timing the
release with precision to hit the 5-minute mark. Through multiple trials
and tweaks, students not only learn the science behind pill coatings but
also experience the challenges and triumphs of real-world problem-solving.
This hands-on activity is a fascinating blend of creativity, science, and
teamwork, making the importance of pill coatings come alive in a fun and
engaging way.</p>

<h3>2024</h3>
<p><strong>1. Sec 1 miniSTEM Activity: Grow Your Own Crystals!</strong>
</p>
<p>In Term 2, Secondary 1 students embarked on a hands-on STEM project, growing
copper (II) sulfate crystals. Over a week-long experiment, they explored
key scientific concepts such as solute, solvent, and saturation. By carefully
mixing solutions and adjusting variables, students gained a deeper understanding
of chemical processes while developing problem-solving skills. Their successful
cultivation of vibrant blue crystals highlighted the practical application
of classroom knowledge, sparking curiosity and interest in STEM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>2. Secondary 2 STEM Highlight: Ice Box Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>During Term 2, Secondary 2 students teamed up to design and construct
DIY ice boxes using recycled materials. This challenge encouraged students
to apply their understanding of heat transfer and sustainability concepts.
Teams tested their ice boxes by measuring the amount of ice that melted
after exposure to the Sun. The winning teams, with the most effective insulation,
were awarded prizes. Student reflections emphasised the enjoyment and educational
value of the challenge, which made science come to life for many participants.</p>

<p><strong>3. Secondary 2 STEM Highlight: Vomitus STEM Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>In Term 3, Secondary 2 students applied their knowledge of food tests
to solve a forensic mystery. Using iodine, Benedict’s, biuret, and alcohol
emulsion tests, they analysed a vomit sample to detect starch, glucose,
protein, and fats, identifying the culprit based on their findings. This
engaging, hands-on activity enhanced their understanding of food tests
while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
