<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The experiential nature of science through authentic learning tasks, performance
tasks, experiments and projects cannot be dissected from the learning process
of the subject area. Science lessons in Meridian Secondary School are conducted
to elicit students’ sense of inquiry and discovery as well as to inculcate
learning using all their senses. As part of the nation-wide Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our science tasks and activities are
designed with the use of students’ personal learning devices to support
their out-of-classroom Science teaching and learning experiences.</p>

<h3>Transforming Teaching &amp; Learning to ICT-based Lesson Packages</h3>
<p>The Science department continues to develop lesson resources for bite-sized
learning for both the lower and upper secondary Science levels. ICT and
bite-sized checkpoints for Assessments for Learning (AfL) are conscientiously
included with the aim of positive student outcomes.
<br>
<br>With the push for 21st Century Competencies (21CC), it is necessary to
prepare students to be able to develop:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>effective communication</strong>, sharing ideas and expressing
opinions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>collaborative skills</strong>through group work learning and project-based
learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expose students to a variety of learning experiences especially the use
of ICT tools since they are<strong> digital learners.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a new area of focus this year would be the application of ICT-enabled
lessons in our daily lessons, using the Design Thinking approach as well
as the structure of&nbsp;<strong>I Do, We Do, You Do</strong>&nbsp;in the
lesson to improve students’ confidence and attain achievement
<br>
<br>Our programmes aim to give students the experience of conducting investigative
science projects and provide them with a platform for scientific exchange.
Students will be given opportunities to be engaged in Science workshops,
learning journeys and competitions at various Science institutions.
<br>
<br>The department continues to provide opportunities for students from all
classes and streams to participate in external Science competitions.</p>
<p><u>Framework:</u>

<p>The Science Enrichment framework is modelled from the NE, “Head, Heart
and Hands” framework.</p>

<h3>2024 Highlights</h3>
<p><strong>1. Sec 1 miniSTEM Activity: Grow Your Own Crystals!</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In Term 2, Secondary 1 students embarked on a hands-on STEM project, growing
copper (II) sulfate crystals. Over a week-long experiment, they explored
key scientific concepts such as solute, solvent, and saturation. By carefully
mixing solutions and adjusting variables, students gained a deeper understanding
of chemical processes while developing problem-solving skills. Their successful
cultivation of vibrant blue crystals highlighted the practical application
of classroom knowledge, sparking curiosity and interest in STEM.</p>

<br>For Mad Mocktail Strikes Again!, students designed their own mocktails
by identifying the densities of different liquids, such as syrups and juices.
Using the concept of density, they create an attractive mocktail with different
coloured layers for their signature mocktails.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
