<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The experiential nature of science through authentic learning tasks, performance
tasks, experiments and projects cannot be dissected from the learning process
of the subject area. Science lessons in Meridian Secondary School are conducted
to elicit students’ sense of inquiry and discovery as well as to inculcate
learning using all their senses. As part of the nation-wide Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our science tasks and activities are
designed with the use of students’ personal learning devices to support
their out-of-classroom Science teaching and learning experiences.</p>
<h3>Transforming Teaching &amp; Learning to ICT-based Lesson Packages</h3>
<p>The Science department continues to develop lesson resources for bite-sized
learning for both the lower and upper secondary Science levels. ICT and
bite-sized checkpoints for Assessments for Learning (AfL) are conscientiously
included with the aim of positive student outcomes.
<br>
<br>With the push for 21st Century Competencies (21CC), it is necessary to
prepare students to be able to develop:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>effective communication</strong>, sharing ideas and expressing
opinions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>collaborative skills</strong>through group work learning and project-based
learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expose students to a variety of learning experiences especially the use
of ICT tools since they are<strong> digital learners.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a new area of focus this year would be the application of ICT-enabled
lessons in our daily lessons, using the Design Thinking approach as well
as the structure of&nbsp;<strong>I Do, We Do, You Do</strong>&nbsp;in the
lesson to improve students’ confidence and attain achievement
<br>
<br>Our programmes aim to give students the experience of conducting investigative
science projects and provide them with a platform for scientific exchange.
Students will be given opportunities to be engaged in Science workshops,
learning journeys and competitions at various Science institutions.
<br>
<br>The department continues to provide opportunities for students from all
classes and streams to participate in external Science competitions.</p>
<p><u>Framework:</u>
</p>
<p>The Science Enrichment framework is modelled from the NE, “Head, Heart
and Hands” framework.</p>

<h3>2024 Highlights</h3>
<p><strong>Sec1 miniSTEM activity – Grow Your Own Crystals! </strong>
</p>
<p>In Term 2, our Secondary 1 students embarked on an exciting STEM journey,
growing copper (II) sulfate crystals. Throughout the week-long experiment,
they delved into key scientific concepts such as saturation, solute, and
solvent. Students meticulously mixed solutions to the point of saturation,
observing how variables affect crystal formation. This hands-on activity
not only enhanced their understanding of chemical processes but also encouraged
critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Their successful cultivation
of vibrant blue crystals showcased the practical application of classroom
knowledge, sparking curiosity and a deeper appreciation for science.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Secondary Two STEM Highlight in Term 2: Ice Box Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary Two students worked in teams of 2 or 3 to construct a DIY
ice box over the span of two weeks. They used various recycled materials
in this STEM task, in line with the school’s push to educate students on
the practices of sustainability.</p>
<p>The students made use of the concepts that they learnt about the processes
of heat transfer to brainstorm on the design of the ice box. Using the
knowledge that they gained from lessons in school and their own research,
they chose appropriate materials that could insulate the ice box and keep
its contents cool.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the ice box was evaluated by measuring the amount
of ice that melted while the ice box was placed under the Sun for some
time. For each class, the team with the smallest amount of melted water
was declared the winner of the challenge and given a small prize.</p>
<p>In their reflections submitted after the activity, most students expressed
that they found the challenge interesting and fun. Through this STEM highlight,
the school has made Science come alive for the students.</p>

<h3>2022 Highlights</h3>
<h4>Meridian Science Enrichment</h4>
<p><strong>Science Centre Workshops</strong> 
<br>Our Sec 1 students were engaged in a Science Centre Singapore workshop
called “The Science of Making Candy” during the Term 2 Week 10 Experiential
Learning Programme. The students learned about the different types of sugar
and how they are made into candies using interfering agents.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journey to Greensproutz and Kok Fah Technology Farm</strong> 
<br>All Sec 1 students went on a learning journey to Singapore’s modern agricultural
farms as part of their Term 2 Week 10 Experiential Learning Programme.
A few classes went on a tour at Kok Fah Technology Farm and learned the
science behind hydroponics. The remaining classes went on a sustainable
journey at Greensproutz to learn how recycled items are used to make terrariums.
At the end of their learning journeys, students brought home new science
knowledge and souvenirs!</p>

<p><strong>Biology AEM: ApLM Discovering Pharmacy @ Temasek Polytechnic</strong> 
<br>Our Sec 3 Biology students had the opportunity to attend Temasek Polytechnic’s
Discovering Pharmacy AEM during their March Holidays. In the 4-day course,
they learned about the different types of medications, focusing on over-the-counter
medications, principles of optimizing drug therapy as well as responsible
and proper self-medication. The AEM introduces students to the products
and services of a pharmacy and they get to know the industry through sharing
conducted by industry practitioners and lecturers.</p>

<h3>2021 Highlights</h3>
<h4>Science External Competitions</h4>
<p><strong>IgnITE Competitions</strong> IgnITE Skills Challenge is Singapore’s
first and only national competition for ‘N’ level students where students
can enjoy learning in the fun-filled and hands-on activities! All teams
that signed up for the challenges first attended a workshop to learn the
basic knowledge needed for their competition. After which, they took part
in the preliminary challenge to come up with their product within the stipulated
time frame.
<br>
<br>Meridian Secondary School selected a total of 9 teams of Sec 3 Normal
Academic/Technical students to take part in 4 challenges: Digital Media
Story Telling, Mad Mocktail Strikes Again!, Potion Alchemy and Daedalus
Challenge.
<br>
<br>Under Science, teams were sent for the Mad Mocktail Strikes Again! and
the Daedalus Challenge.
<br>
<br>For Mad Mocktail Strikes Again!, students designed their own mocktails
by identifying the densities of different liquids, such as syrups and juices.
Using the concept of density, they create an attractive mocktail with different
coloured layers for their signature mocktails.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:60%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Science-08.jpg">

<p>For the Daedalus Challenge, students developed skills in using computer-aided
design (CAD) software to design and assembled an aerodynamic glider that
can clear obstacles.
<br>
<br>With their crafty glider skills, one of the teams for the Daedalus Challenge
made their way to be one of the finalist teams! 2021 ITE Skills Challenge
