### Our Approach
The experiential nature of science through authentic learning tasks, performance tasks, experiments and projects cannot be dissected from the learning process of the subject area. Science lessons in Meridian Secondary School are conducted to elicit students’ sense of inquiry and discovery as well as to inculcate learning using all their senses. As part of the nation-wide Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP), our science tasks and activities are designed with the use of students’ personal learning devices to support their out-of-classroom Science teaching and learning experiences.

### Transforming Teaching &amp; Learning to ICT-based Lesson Packages
The Science department continues to develop lesson resources for bite-sized learning for both the lower and upper secondary Science levels. ICT and bite-sized checkpoints for Assessments for Learning (AfL) are conscientiously included with the aim of positive student outcomes.<br><br>
With the push for 21st Century Competencies (21CC), it is necessary to prepare students to be able to develop:<p></p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>effective communication</b>, sharing ideas and expressing opinions</li>
				<li><b>collaborative skills</b>through group work learning and project-based learning</li>
				<li>expose students to a variety of learning experiences especially the use of ICT tools since they are<b> digital learners.</b></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, a new area of focus this year would be the application of ICT-enabled lessons in our daily lessons, using the Design Thinking approach as well as the structure of&nbsp;<b>I Do, We Do, You Do</b>&nbsp;in the lesson to improve students’ confidence and attain achievement<br><br>
Our programmes aim to give students the experience of conducting investigative science projects and provide them with a platform for scientific exchange. Students will be given opportunities to be engaged in Science workshops, learning journeys and competitions at various Science institutions.<br><br>
The department continues to provide opportunities for students from all classes and streams to participate in external Science competitions.</p>
			<p><u>Framework:</u></p>
			<p>The Science Enrichment framework is modelled from the NE, “Head, Heart and Hands” framework.</p>
			<img src="/images/01.png" style="width:50%">
			<p><b>Objective</b>: To inculcate passion in Science and provide a progressive and holistic Science education which extends beyond the classroom and curriculum.

### 2022 Highlights
	
#### Meridian Science Enrichment

**Science Centre Workshops**<br>
Our Sec 1 students were engaged in a Science Centre Singapore workshop called “The Science of Making Candy” during the Term 2 Week 10 Experiential Learning Programme. The students learned about the different types of sugar and how they are made into candies using interfering agents.

**Learning Journey to Greensproutz and Kok Fah Technology Farm**<br>
All Sec 1 students went on a learning journey to Singapore’s modern agricultural farms as part of their Term 2 Week 10 Experiential Learning Programme. A few classes went on a tour at Kok Fah Technology Farm and learned the science behind hydroponics. The remaining classes went on a sustainable journey at Greensproutz to learn how recycled items are used to make terrariums. At the end of their learning journeys, students brought home new science knowledge and souvenirs!

<br>

**Biology AEM: ApLM Discovering Pharmacy @ Temasek Polytechnic**<br>
Our Sec 3 Biology students had the opportunity to attend Temasek Polytechnic’s Discovering Pharmacy AEM during their March Holidays. In the 4-day course, they learned about the different types of medications, focusing on over-the-counter medications, principles of optimizing drug therapy as well as responsible and proper self-medication. The AEM introduces students to the products and services of a pharmacy and they get to know the industry through sharing conducted by industry practitioners and lecturers.

#### Science External Competitions
**Singapore National Crystal Growing Competition**<br>
The Singapore National Crystal Growing Competition is organised by the National University of Singapore for all secondary schools to encourage the learning and mastery in the art of crystal growing.<br><br>
Two students represented our school in the 15th&nbsp;Singapore National Crystal Growing Competition. Under the guidance of Mr Arthur Lee, they spent weeks in the planning and optimisation of their lab procedure for the growth of ammonium nickel (II) sulfate.

<br>			
All Sec 2 students participated in the STEM Playground Challenge #2: Dome Sweet Dome, where they are tasked to build a geodesic dome using any materials. After building their domes, students have to test the support strength of the dome by stacking handphones! From each class, a winning entry with the strongest structure built with sustainable or recyclable materials was selected.

#### Meridian Science Programmes
Meridian Science Program is a series of programmes that aim to enhance students’ interest in science and stretch their learning in Science. Through various activities, students improve scientific communication by working and presenting on projects of interest. Students are exposed to extra-curricular experimental laboratory sessions in school, workshops and competitions. Through structured guidance and inquiry based exploration, we aim to nurture curiosity, intellectual perseverance and confidence in our students.

**Meridian Young Scientist**<br>
The Meridian Young Scientist is a stretching programme for Sec 1 students to stretch and apply their knowledge in science. An award card is given to all students to encourage students to apply their learning and enjoy learning Science through various activities.<br><br>
In 2022, the Meridian Young Scientist is renewed and updated with more exciting tasks! This time, it was organised as part of the 2022 Meridian Science Week. Students are given a choice of being “The Creative”, “The Erudite” or “The Explainer”, depending on the list of activities that they have completed. From their submissions, students completed their tasks with creativity and dedication.

### 2021 Highlights
#### Science External Competitions

**IgnITE Competitions**
IgnITE Skills Challenge is Singapore’s first and only national competition for ‘N’ level students where students can enjoy learning in the fun-filled and hands-on activities! All teams that signed up for the challenges first attended a workshop to learn the basic knowledge needed for their competition. After which, they took part in the preliminary challenge to come up with their product within the stipulated time frame.<br><br>
Meridian Secondary School selected a total of 9 teams of Sec 3 Normal Academic/Technical students to take part in 4 challenges: Digital Media Story Telling, Mad Mocktail Strikes Again!, Potion Alchemy and Daedalus Challenge.<br><br>
Under Science, teams were sent for the Mad Mocktail Strikes Again! and the Daedalus Challenge.<br><br>
For Mad Mocktail Strikes Again!, students designed their own mocktails by identifying the densities of different liquids, such as syrups and juices. Using the concept of density, they create an attractive mocktail with different coloured layers for their signature mocktails.
