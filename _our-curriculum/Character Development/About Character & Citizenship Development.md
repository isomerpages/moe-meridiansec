<h3>CCE in MSS</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through CCE, students develop character and citizenship dispositions
which enable them to grow holistically. Our school takes reference from
MOE CCE Curriculum Frame to design meaningful learning experiences for
our Meridians.</p>
