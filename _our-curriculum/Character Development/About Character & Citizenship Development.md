<h3>CCE in MSS</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through CCE, students develop character and citizenship dispositions
which enable them to grow holistically. Our school takes reference from
MOE CCE Curriculum Frame to design meaningful learning experiences for
our Meridians.</p>
<h3>Character &amp; Citizenship Development in MSS</h3>
<p>In Meridian Secondary, we emphasise the importance of nurturing Meridians
to be people of good character and useful citizens. Through the programmes
and structures in place, we aim to inculcate values and build social-emotional
competencies to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.</p>

<h1><strong>Highlights</strong></h1>
<h3>Enactment of CCE in The Classroom</h3>
<p>Explicit teaching of knowledge, skills and values take place in the classroom.
Hence, elevating student voice by allowing them to share their experiences,
stories, opinions and differing views in the classroom becomes important
to make learning more authentic. To facilitate this, we leverage on technology,
on top of other facilitation strategies, to increase students’ engagement
and participation in lessons so that they have meaningful discussions on
the various CCE topics. These lessons are facilitated by Form Teachers
or by their peers.</p>

<h3>Positive Education</h3>
<p>Meridian Secondary embarked on Positive Education as an approach to blend
academic learning with character and well-being. Seligman’s revised PERMAH
model was adopted (studied and published by Norrish &amp; Seligman in 2015),
which stands for six elements of psychological well-being and happiness.
The six elements stand for P – Positive Emotions, E – Engagement, R – Relationships,
M – Meaning, A – Achievements and H – Health.</p>
<h3>Thoughtful Thursdays</h3>
<p>To complement our CCE efforts, we initiated Thoughtful Thursdays as part
of Positive Education in Meridian Secondary. It aims to support students
in tackling unprecedented levels of pressure and build mental resilience.
<br>During these sessions, Meridians learn how to manage their mental health
and inculcate positive emotions through a variety of bite-sized activities,
which focus on themes such as Gratitude, Mindfulness, Resilience, etc.</p>
