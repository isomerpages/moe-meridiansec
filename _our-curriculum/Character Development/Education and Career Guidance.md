<p>learn more about the world of work and explore the many possible pathways,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make considered decisions about their education and career plans, and
stay on track to achieve them, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be a lifelong learner who is adaptable and resilient, and equipped with
the 21st century competencies, values and skills.</p>

<h1>Highlights</h1>
<h3>MySkillsFuture Portal</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myskillsfuture.sg/secondary" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ECG Portal – MySkillsFuture</a>&nbsp;is
a valuable source of information and knowledge for students. By completing
the surveys on the portal, students learn more about their interests, strengths
and work values (VIPS). The portal is also a guide to their post-secondary
education. Students are able to learn more about the education landscape,
and explore the Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) as well as
the courses offered by these institutions. They also learn about the world
of work, acquiring knowledge of the Singapore Industry Landscape and the
various job roles.</p>
<p>In Meridian, students utilized MySkillsFuture Portal to find out about
their VIPS and to set academic and non-academic goals to chart their holistic
growth.</p>
