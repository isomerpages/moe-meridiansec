<p>VIA@Meridian adopts the Design Thinking approach when planning VIA projects
or activities for the community. Using Design Thinking as the approach,
it helps students gain&nbsp;<strong>a deeper understanding</strong>&nbsp;of
social issues,&nbsp;<strong>develop empathy</strong>&nbsp;and a desire
to impact the community positively. It equips them with the skills and
knowledge to design solutions to&nbsp;<strong>improve the lives of others</strong>.</p>

<p>VIA Projects are mostly facilitated by Class Chairpersons and Student
Leaders. They attended Facilitation Skills training, Design Thinking Workshop
and VIA Briefings before they lead these projects with their peers.</p>
<h3>Recognition</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students will be recognized for their contributions in LEAPS 2.0 (Service
domain). This domain recognizes students’ development as socially responsible
citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional service hours</strong>&nbsp;will be credited to students
who embark on external VIA activities and other self-volunteering opportunities
subjected to the proper documentation by the external organisations submitted
to HOD CCE for approval and recording.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Highlights</h1>
<h3>Sec 1 VIA: Collaboration with ALP</h3>
<h4>Level Theme: Personal Growth &amp; Self-Care</h4>
<p>Through CCE lessons, students will go through various case studies on
Mental Health and Cyber Wellness before deciding on the area that they
would like to be an advocate in. They will then proceed to come up with
a mascot and a positive message during their ALP/Art lesson in either of
the two areas.</p>
<h3>Sec 2 VIA: Collaboration with Innovation Team and Student Leadership Team</h3>
<h4>Level Theme: Team Learning &amp; Empathy</h4>
<p>Our Sec 3 Student Leaders led their juniors in this project by helping
them to recall the school’s Design Thinking Framework, Feel-Think-Do-Share.
Together with the Sec 2 Class Chairpersons, they helped to facilitate the
discussions to plan and execute a school event.</p>

food items to the organisation.</p>
