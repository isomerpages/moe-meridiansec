#### **Meridian Secondary School will be embarking on the Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) journey in 2023 with our incoming Secondary One cohort.**

_What this means is that:_

*   Our Secondary One students will be placed in **mixed form classes** where students of different courses learn a set of common curriculum subjects together in their lower secondary form classes. The common curriculum subjects includes Character and Citizenship Education, Art, Design & Technology, Food & Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education.
*   Eligible students may also take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary Two onwards.
