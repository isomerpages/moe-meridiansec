#### What is NDLP?

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to&nbsp;**make digital learning inclusive**&nbsp;by&nbsp;**equipping students with the digital skills**&nbsp;to be future-ready. Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will&nbsp;**own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD)**. Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

#### What Does This Mean for My Child?

Students are required to use a Chromebook for their learning throughout the 4 to 5 years of education in Meridian Secondary School. They are expected to bring their Chromebooks home so that they can continue to learn independently and complete their assignments at home.

Students will carry out learning via various platform, such as MOE Student Learning Space (SLS), Google Suite for Education and many more&nbsp; They may also create notes digitally using the Chromebook and organize their learning and resources productively.

#### Why a Chromebook?

A Chromebook is a computing device running Chrome OS as its operating system. The Chromebook is designed for use primarily while connected to the internet, with most of its applications and data residing online.

3.  Weight: Chromebooks are lightweight, that are portable and easy to carry around
4.  Battery: long battery life
