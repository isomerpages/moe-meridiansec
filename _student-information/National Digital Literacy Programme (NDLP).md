<h4>What is NDLP?</h4>
<p>The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to&nbsp;<strong>make digital learning inclusive</strong>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>equipping students with the digital skills</strong>&nbsp;to
be future-ready. Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will&nbsp;<strong>own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD)</strong>.
Students may use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.</p>
<h4>What Does This Mean for My Child?</h4>
<p>Students are required to use a Chromebook for their learning throughout
the 4 to 5 years of education in Meridian Secondary School. They are expected
to bring their Chromebooks home so that they can continue to learn independently
and complete their assignments at home.</p>
<p>Students will carry out learning via various platform, such as MOE Student
Learning Space (SLS), Google Suite for Education and many more&nbsp; They
may also create notes digitally using the Chromebook and organize their
learning and resources productively.</p>
<h4>Why a Chromebook?</h4>
<p>A Chromebook is a computing device running Chrome OS as its operating
system. The Chromebook is designed for use primarily while connected to
the internet, with most of its applications and data residing online.</p>
