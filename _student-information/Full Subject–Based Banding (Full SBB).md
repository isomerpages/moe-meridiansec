**Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)** is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.
<br><br>
Meridian Secondary School will be embarking on the Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) journey in 2023 with our incoming Secondary One cohort.
<br><br>
With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs. 


_What this means is that:_

*   There will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) courses, and our Secondary One students will be placed in&nbsp;**mixed form classes**&nbsp;where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.
*   All students will learn a set of common curriculum subjects together in their lower secondary form classes. The common curriculum subjects includes Character and Citizenship Education, Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education.
*   Under Full SBB, Subject-Based Banding (SBB) will be expanded beyond the four PSLE subjects, to allow eligible students to offer Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.
