<p><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</strong> is part of MOE's
ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways
to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.
<br>
<br>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where
students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall
strengths, interests and learning needs.</p>
<p><em>What this means is that:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) courses, and
our Secondary One students will be placed in&nbsp;<strong>mixed form classes</strong>&nbsp;where
they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All students will learn a set of common curriculum subjects together in
their lower secondary form classes. The common curriculum subjects includes
Character and Citizenship Education, Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food
&amp; Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Full SBB, Subject-Based Banding (SBB) will be expanded beyond the
four PSLE subjects, to allow eligible students to offer Humanities subjects
at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Offering subjects at a more demanding level</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><em>At the start of Secondary One</em></strong></h4>
<p>Eligible students can offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong> at
a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each
of these subjects.</p>

<h4><strong><em>Beyond the start of Secondary One</em></strong></h4>
<p>From Secondary 2 (S2), students will also be able to offer <strong>Humanities subjects</strong> (Geography,
History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level. The criteria
for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students'
aptitude for and interest in these subjects at S1.</p>

<h3><strong>Offering subjects at a less demanding level</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><em>At the start of Secondary One</em></strong></h4>
<p>For students who offered English, Mathematics and/or Science at Foundation
level at PSLE, but are otherwise eligible to take most of their subjects
at G3 when entering secondary school, they may choose to take these subjects
at a less demanding level (i.e., G2), in consultation with their secondary
schools.</p>
<p>Students who face exceptional difficulties coping with their Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer G1 or G2 MTL. At the start
of Secondary One, students can offer MTL at a less demanding level based
on the following criteria:</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<h4><strong><em>Beyond the start of Secondary One</em></strong></h4>
<p>Students may offer subjects at a less demanding level, based on their
performance and schools’ holistic assessment, to calibrate their academic
load.</p>
<p>Schools will also have the discretion to allow students with difficulties
coping with MTL to offer MTL at a less demanding level, based on holistic
considerations.</p>
<p>Students who offer subjects at a less demanding level may subsequently
offer the subjects at a more demanding level as they gain greater competence
and confidence in the subjects.</p>
<p>The increased flexibility empowers students to take greater ownership
of their learning according to their subject-specific strengths and interests.</p>
<h4><strong><em>New Grading Scheme for Examinable Common Curriculum Subjects</em></strong></h4>
<p>With effect from 2025, a new grading scheme will be implemented for examinable
common curriculum subjects at lower secondary level. These subjects are
Art, Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T), and Food &amp; Consumer Education
(FCE).</p>
<p>Under this new system, student performance will be assessed using a four-level
grading scale:</p>

<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Screenshot_2025_02_19_161216.png">
</div>
<p>This grading scheme will provide clearer feedback on students’ progress
and skills. This grading system will take effect beginning with<strong> Weighted Assessment (WA) 1 in 2025.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>How This Will Appear on Students’ Result Slip</strong>
</p>
<p>The new grading system will be reflected in students’ result slip under
the “Grade” column. Instead of traditional letter grades or numerical scores,
students’ performance in Art, D&amp;T, and FCE will be categorised as<strong> PF, CP, DV, or BG</strong>,
as shown in the example below:</p>

group of friends and appreciate the strengths of different classmates.
