<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements
and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.</p>
<p>Meridian Secondary School (MSS) extends a warm invitation to Primary 6
students to apply for direct admission into the school for academic year
2025 before the Secondary One Posting Exercise.</p>
<p><strong>MSS offers DSA in the following Sports Talent Areas:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Basketball (Boys only)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Floorball (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Football (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested and would like to join us, you may seek admission
through DSA. We will be admitting Secondary One students for 2025 through
