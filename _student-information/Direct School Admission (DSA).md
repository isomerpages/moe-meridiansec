Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE. 

Meridian Secondary School (MSS) extends a warm invitation to Primary 6 students to apply for direct admission into the school for academic year 2024 before the Secondary One Posting Exercise. 


MSS offers DSA in the following Sports Talent Areas:
*   Basketball (Boys only)
*   Floorball (Boys &amp; Girls)
*   Football (Boys &amp; Girls)

If you are interested and would like to join us, you may seek admission through DSA.  We will be admitting Secondary One students for 2024 through the MOE DSA-SEC Exercise 2023.
