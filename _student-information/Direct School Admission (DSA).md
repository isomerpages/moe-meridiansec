<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements
and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.</p>
<p>Meridian Secondary School (MSS) extends a warm invitation to Primary 6
students to apply for direct admission into the school for academic year
2026 before the Secondary One Posting Exercise.&nbsp;</p>
