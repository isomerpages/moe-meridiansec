<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements
and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Meridian Secondary School (MSS) extends a warm invitation to Primary
6 students to apply for direct admission into the school for academic year
2026 before the Secondary One Posting Exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Meridian Secondary School offers DSA for the following Sports Talent Areas:</h4>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Floorball (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Football (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are interested and would like to join us, you may seek admission
through DSA.&nbsp; We will be admitting Secondary One students for 2026
through the MOE DSA-SEC Exercise 2025.</p>
