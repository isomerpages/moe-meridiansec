<p>Dear parent/guardian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please be informed that the application for financial assistance
in 2025 is now open. You can apply for your child/ward via the hardcopy
form (see the attachment below) or e-FAS form which is available on Parents
Gateway (under Services tab – Financial Assistance) via Singpass login.
When applying via e-FAS, you will still need to provide the required supporting
documents (e.g. pay slips, CPF statements etc), but in softcopy for the
school to verify and assess eligibility as per current practice.</p>
