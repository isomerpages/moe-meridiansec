<h4>Supporting Your Teen</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Parents / Guardians of Secondary 4E &amp; 5N Meridians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2025 O-Level results will be released on Wednesday, 14 January 2026.
Arrangements have been made for students to receive their results from
2.00 pm onwards. Students must be in <strong>proper school attire and personal grooming</strong> to
receive their results from their form teachers in the school hall.&nbsp;
Students who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to
school to collect their results.</p>
<p>Students who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification
when collecting the results. You may contact the school for assistance
with the appointment of a proxy.</p>
<p>Parents / Guardians are invited to be present during the release of results.
The school will open from 1.30 pm onwards. Please be seated by 1.45 pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If there are insufficient parking spaces in the school compound,
please co-operate with our security guards when they direct you to park
your vehicles at the nearby HDB car parks.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know that
they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define them
or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially
valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions and be
positive when deciding on their next steps.</p>
<p>Do take this opportunity to have further open conversations with your
teens about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.</p>
<p><em>(PDPA) Invited parents / guardians are reminded to take images (photos/videos) or post images on social media of your own child / ward only. Please respect the privacy of our students by refraining from taking or posting images of other students.&nbsp;</em>
