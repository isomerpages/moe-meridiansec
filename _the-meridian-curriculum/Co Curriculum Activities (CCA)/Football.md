The winning spirit is not just about goal scoring. It is about the values we cherish and uphold as footballers – teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship. It also means growing as a team in a respectful, positive and healthy environment.

  
Under the leadership of Coach Fabio, we have performed admirably since our founding days in 2017, when we won the Schools National C Division football title.

  
In 2019, we emerged as National Champions for the Boys and Girls Inter School Futsal Competition. Both our C Division boys and girls have clinched the 2nd Runners-Up place in the National School Games. Our strong performance has earned our team a place in the elite Under-15 League competition, in which we emerged as the runner up in 2019.

  
Even when the pandemic put a pause on the National School Games, our footballers continued to hone their technical skills and improve their appreciation of team play and in April 2021, an intra-school tournament was organised.

  
Meridian Football is a young team. This year we have come back hungry for the win. We will continue to work hard to be able to achieve greater heights this year and in the years to come.

### Student Experience

_“The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.”_

  
Our main objective is to develop the love and interest of football in students. Fast footwork, agility and endurance are just a few of the essentials for playing football. It is also our key goal to help students maximise their full potential and hone their technical skills.

  
Other values such as commitment, perseverance, confidence, respect and camaraderie are inculcated in the students to develop them to be a competent player and a better individual. More importantly, our footballers learn more than just the rules of play. They gain the tools, values and attitudes to be on the front foot in life.
