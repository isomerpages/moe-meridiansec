VIA@Meridian adopts the Design Thinking approach when planning VIA projects or activities for the community. Using Design Thinking as the approach, it helps students gain **a deeper understanding** of social issues, **develop empathy** and a desire to impact the community positively. It equips them with the skills and knowledge to design solutions to **improve the lives of others**.

VIA Projects are mostly facilitated by Class Chairpersons and Student Leaders. They attended Facilitation Skills training, Design Thinking Workshop and VIA Briefings before they lead these projects with their peers.

### Recognition

*   Students will be recognized for their contributions in LEAPS 2.0 (Service domain). This domain recognizes students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community.
*   **Additional service hours** will be credited to students who embark on external VIA activities and other self-volunteering opportunities subjected to the proper documentation by the external organisations submitted to HOD CCE for approval and recording.

# Highlights

### Sec 1 VIA: Collaboration with ALP

#### Level Theme: Personal Growth & Self-Care

Through CCE lessons, students will go through various case studies on Mental Health and Cyber Wellness before deciding on the area that they would like to be an advocate in. They will then proceed to come up with a mascot and a positive message during their ALP/Art lesson in either of the two areas.

### Sec 2 VIA: Collaboration with Innovation Team and Student Leadership Team

#### Level Theme: Team Learning & Empathy

Our Sec 3 Student Leaders led their juniors in this project by helping them to recall the school’s Design Thinking Framework, Feel-Think-Do-Share. Together with the Sec 2 Class Chairpersons, they helped to facilitate the discussions to plan and execute a school event.
