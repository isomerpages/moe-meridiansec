<h4>Supporting Your Teen</h4>
<p>Dear Parents / Guardians of Secondary 4E &amp; 5N Meridians,</p>
<p>The 2024 O-Level results will be released on Friday, 10 Jan 2025. Arrangements
have been made for students to receive their results from 2.30 pm onwards.
Students must be in school attire and personal grooming to receive their
results from their form teachers in the school hall.&nbsp; Students who
are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to collect
their results.</p>
<p>Students who are unable to collect their results in person can also appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification
when collecting the results. You may contact the school for assistance
with the appointment of a proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Parents / Guardians are invited to be present during the release
of results. The school will be opened from 2.00 pm onwards. Please be seated
by 2.20 pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If there are insufficient parking spaces in the school compound,
parents / guardians can park their vehicles at the nearby HDB car parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(PDPA) Invited parents / guardians are reminded to take images (photos/videos)
or post images on social media of your own child / ward only. Please respect
the privacy of our students by refraining from taking or posting images
of other students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know
that they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define
them or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will
be especially valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions
and be positive when deciding on their next steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Do take this opportunity to have further open conversations with
your teen about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.</p>
